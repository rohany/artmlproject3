Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world (x2)
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world

[Verse 1]
She say she want to stay with the Bloods and Crips
Feel the front strips of inner-city cliques
Where free cunt strips and young blood drips
And kids fall through the holes of hollow gun tips
And you want to harm me, don't try to call me
You ain't gone calm me, you're slipping from my palm trees
Now baby please re-l-a-x
Together we 'bout as fly as LAX
And I don't want to have to call you my ex
Well babe, I don't want to have to call you collect
See, she say she got dreams to follow
How I'ma ever be her man, nigga, she wants to be a model
My sunshine in life got stole away
Once the Golden State took my gold away, Cali

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You scold as you walk past her
No more truth lang, we only talk sarcasm
Truttin', outtin', need to be a model
Now you can catch me giving hickeys to beer bottles
Get it, cause I'm kissing the neck
Giving a heck for whether or not you give him respect
I know if you go, you just might glow
But if you leave, you could catch more than a cold
Bulimia, anorexia, you skip meals
You don't make the cut but that's how your wrist feel
Cause scripts rip slits in the hands of an actress
In the acting world, you'll find allies on the axis
You'll find actresses in alleys on their backs
With directors giving oral in return for a practice

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Trees, trees, please don't leave
But trees will be changed when it rains, will they shout to you
We was kissing under a tree when I fell for you
I thought that you was real, I guess I couldn't tell the truth
Trees go knee-deep in the dirt
They reach for the sky but they're still down to earth
But you, you just leave like leaves in the autumn
Didn't think you would get on, get gone, and just out 'em
Doubt them and reroute them, not count 'em
I'd never leave you for the chance of an album
Your roots stay deeper, I can't de-weed ya
I can't walk away, away from this tree, uh
And as bad as I want to see you running back
I could never ever ever be your lumberjack, Cali[Intro]
I say I love you
And I've said more
My one and only
I can't lose no, no

[Verse 1]
Hey Ma, Hey Ma I know I never did behave a lot
Never got good grades a lot
And turned your hairs to grays a lot
And go in stores and take a lot
And never shopped but saved a lot
So you ain't gotta shop at Save A Lot
And you ain't gotta worry about Chase a lot
They playing with your checks, your shit
Cause they gonna take your pay or not
Que Sera, gotta then, fuck them niggas you smarter than
We just gonna beg your pardon them
Save Money, my partner and them
I'm part of them, It's part of me
This Save Mula, Bo Squad at three
I'm riding around my side of town
Hot boxing no cops around
I had the tux I had the gown
Just had a show, just had to bounce
It's Chance ho, #10Day
Chano no hable englais
That language be that chanish but ooh! Muy caliente
So she just gonna throw her steps on
And haters gonna throw that epsom
And we just gonna throw a party
And I'm gonna just throw my teflon
Cause family be that plug though
And I ain't even flexin
But twin bro be that Victor
And Big Cuz be that Chef Sean[Intro]
Igh
Shouts to SC
Good doctors
Pat, this hot ass apartment
And that weak ass beer

[Verse 1]
Yo, Yo, Gots to show

[Verse 2]
I'm coming back with true force

Came back from New York
Watching the two doors
Hop outta the two door
Igh
She told me that grandma got some tumors
And she just got two more
I'm asking ma
What you knew [?]
She said Oo Lord Oo Lord
Where we going
Where we going back now
I heard that you had to back down
From a couple different deals
And now you taking pills
And now you in [?]
And your bitches [?]
That shit dope
Get a house in the hills
I ask her if she need a couple meals
I told Def I need a couple mil
They ain't give me the Kanye treatment
Gave them a video
A hard ass treatment
Gave them something
And I [?]
You know I'm out tweaking
And every weekend
I'm feeling so decent
I'm calling the deacon

[Outro]
What's good
What's church
What's word, my nigga
I just had to swerve, my nigga
A little weed and some liquor, my nigga
I'm going off the top of them words, my nigga
We lost at sea
I'm... Did it really stop?
I'm sorry[Intro: Chance The Rapper, (The Social Experiment), Taylor Bennett]

[Verse: Taylor Bennett]
How you doing? It's Taylor Bennett, the famous rapper
I wanna take you out and maybe even party after
You can crash in, prolly catch the morning after
Got booked over paper, that's another chapter
I wanna move to the hills where the breeze right
Know I like it when your pencil start to write
We gotta get it on the dance floor tonight
Baby, I'm a smooth typer, baby, I'm a you type
Woke about my future, line up reality
Mind of a different galaxy
Mama said eat your vegetables, celery turns to salary
Selling souls while I'm only addicted to forms of casualty
Casualty is a tragedy
Young cause of catastrophe, drop boy moving galleries
Evil is just a half of me
Greatest grace, my anatomy
Adam and Eve's apple in me, probably screaming feel 'em
Dreamin' thank god for the trade I, for the way I
Roll up in a Beemer, hold up, slick nigga
Moving that weight, fit nigga, guap, guap
Rich nigga, doper than dope
I got bricks in the side of my watch cause my wrist killing
Niggas be tweaking, I'm tweaking them out
So why I'm the nigga you tweeting about?
Trashy ass rappers, I'm cleaning them out
See, be the reason my phone ringing out
Give me a call about nothing at all
Giving me calls about nothing at all
Giving me calls about nothing at all
Giving me calls about nothing at all

[Intro: Chance the Rapper + The Dells]
All
All, all, all
All the things
All the things, things
All that glitters is not gold
All, all, all, and all gold is not reality
Real is what you lays on me
How's everybody doing?

[Pre-Verse]
We were all that matters, family's all that matters
This is just business, see you right after
Nothing comes before ya, nothing else matters
All of this is for ya, you are all that matters

[Verse]
I dance around the darkness down on Billie Jean Road
If I ain’t toured then we still’d be broke
Thought I got the formula, bon appetite
I got a beat in case my baby baba ever leak
Wise beyond my years but way behind my peak
You gotta eat, this a step to my princess
Point of interest, fourth and inches
Hallelujah, the kid grew up, the crowd cheered the child
Booya, mic drop, I walk home

[Hook: Macie Stewart & Teddy Jackson (Chance the Rapper & Sample)]
I don't care about, they don't mean a thing (All, all)
All these fancy things (All, all)
I'll tell you that all, my weight in gold (All)
All I know, I know (And all gold is not reality)
All these things
All these things
All these things
All these things

[Break: Chance the Rapper]
In this part of my life, I'm growing up and I- and I wanna, I wanna do this the right way, go, go out of it, grow out of it, in the best way possible, so thank you guys who's been there thus far, and it's only gonna get better...

[Hook: Chance the Rapper, Macie Stewart, & Teddy Jackson (Chance the Rapper & Sample)]
I don't care bout, they don't mean a thing
All these fancy things
I'll tell you that all, my weight in gold (All that glitters, glitters)
All I know, I know (Is not gold, Igh!)
All these things (All that matters)
All these things (All, all that matters)
All these things (You are all that matters)[Intro]
Yooooo Yooooo Yoooo
Will we continue on
String along
We need time
Yooooo Yooooo Yoooo
Will we continue on
String along
We need time

[Verse 1: Cass Lowe]
You reach into the bowl of car keys
Making eye contact, as if to say 'hows that"
Are you fucking happy now
Grab his wrist and wriggle past me
As Jenny licks her lips
Time to teach a young dog tricks
And how to bow
Remember when you couldn't hurt me
We reached a breaking point
As you lit your joint and we crossed the severn bridge
For the addy and your cold out, splow me out
Again

[Hook]
And you kiss him
And I kiss her
And I love her
We all go home again

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
She know my favorite flavor skittles
She know everything we argue 'bout
Where everything in our crib at
And every time you walk up out
She know whenever we fighting and whenever we cool
But my favorite thing she know is that she'll never be you
She know she'll never have her song, She know she'll never have my son
She know she'll never have your pain, she'll never have to have a hunch
She know everyone that I lie about, heard every freaking word
She know everything you wonder bout, and it hurt her even worse
Who'd you rather be?

Wala[Intro]
People try to come at me and like
On some like, I only write slow songs
And I only write...church and
How many of y'all are messing with me with a pen, period?

[Verse]
I'm a writer, probably as good as Elton John
But whats writing good for if it ain't helping moms?
I'm tryna feed Japan while seeing sights of Lebanon
And wiping away tears of girls that's getting felted on
I'm tryna get my felt pen on but the block is hot
My hands is questioning if I'm bach or not
If I'm 2Pac or nonexistent to these juggernauts
But I'm a architect an astronaut an argonaut
So hey, you, get off my couch
You don't know me sta out my mouth
But I'm a writer you can quote it out loud
A false poet get my dough and I'm out
But here's an eighth of shrooms for your earlobe
A little rap
A little bit of Wu-Tang, mixed with some Henry David Thoreau
A little ponder theory you can ponder on your pillow
But this is for the day that your dad dies
But for some reason all you hearing is sad sighs
You searchin' for nostalgia but sad and you can't cry
So you check your iPod in search for some bad vibes
From that rap guy, who raps over sad vibes
I wrote it in an hour dawg, don't know what your dad's like
He probably was a great dad, he's probably in paradise
You want deeply in heartbreak and sadly I can't write, nothing
This is for those who wrote suicide notes
And all the hipster girls that was super fly dope
You looking at her nose what you do besides coke
You looking at her palms what you do besides dope
Nothing, life is but a supersized note
I open up my mind like suicide door
And grab a pimp cane and a superfly coat
Have they bobbing they heads to something stupid I wrote
I hope[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Today I missed my workout, but it worked out
Now I'm missing work now, but it worked out
Had to buy a crib, 'fore I bought my first house
Had my first kid, I love how she turned out
I love how she turned up, even if I'm burned out
I'ma have so many seeds, I could have a birdhouse
I'ma love on they mama, I hope it work out
I hope it work out

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Luckily, my ex ugly
I don't eat, so she can't get no lunch with me
I don't reach, so she can't get in touch with me
Can't be buds with me
Don't know what to be
She gon' cuss at me
Told her "give it a rest," so I keep custody
Keep it all side-eyes and side-hugs with me
I know that my girl's trust is a luxury
I don't want my next album sounding all Usher-y
But I must confess, I must confess
For every single ex, I want the best
I really wish you nothing but success
I know it's gonna work out

[Bridge: Chance The Rapper]
Doesn't it get dark, right before the sun peeks
And bears his face? And doesn't it get so hard to breathe?
But it's gonna work out, it's gonna work out
With nothing left to give, with nothing left to say
When no one says they're wrong, or sets the record straight

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper & Francis and the Lights]
But it's gonna work out, it's gonna work out, it's gonna work out
That shit might hurt now, but I'm with her now
Don't need closure now, just keep the shirt now
Sorry you were led to believe
Bunch of different stories that was never to be
No you isn't ugly I just said it to be
Funny we both know that you look better than me
Sorry I started runnin' when you ran into me
I'm just tryna be the kinda man I'ma be
And I'm getting better gotta hand it to me
Seem to always work out when you hand it to Jesus

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Today I missed my workout, but it worked out
Now I'm missing work now, but it worked out
Had to buy a crib, 'fore I bought my first house
Had my first kid, I love how she turned out
I love how she turned up, even if I'm burned out
I'ma have so many seeds, I could have a birdhouse
I'ma love on they mama, I hope it work out
I hope it work out

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
I believe in long distance love, God that's above
Bond that's so strong can't let y'all bald-headed—
Yeah, y'all interrupt, you all in a rush
We all gon' meet up in the up, in the upper room
If I run into em', I'll be ru-running to em'
We could re-run the show, we could re-bump into 'em
If we read the wrong one, we could re-jump the broom
If we read the wrong one, baby we jump the groom
I'm ready to be groomed
I'm ready to assume, the position is filled
I was ret since the womb
I was not made for this, this was made for me
And it's gonna work out

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Today I missed my workout, but it worked out
Now I'm missing work now, but it worked out
Had to buy a crib, 'fore I bought my first house
Had my first kid, I love how she turned out

Gross 3 mil' off the new hat
If I could go back, I'd make a two cap
Love me in my city like Cusack
Get a little beat and I'll loop that
Get a little money, I'll oop that
Split it with my niggas in the group chat
Left for a minute then I flew back
Had to ask Bruce "where the truth at?"
Had to ask Rahm "where the truth at?"
Now I can't ride with the roof back
Tell 'em I don't play around with other people's kids
Got an office in the steakhouse
Gotta bid for the ribs
Got a meeting at the Ritz
Gave a crib to my rib
'Cause she leaving where I live but I see her in a min
Got a Michael prayer card for the good luck, ay
Bra push up when I pull up, ay
Got a little money from the tour, yeah
Spend it all on baby pull ups, ay
Big old Bentley, bitch I mix the Henny with the Simply
Lemonade exterior, Lorenzos under Bentleys
Put you in the friend zone if you start acting too friendly
Bought a baby Benzo and some Kenzo just for Kensli
Wake up real early but I eat late
Go and hit the streets with that briefcase
Time to shake down another cheap skate
You could tell he's lying, cheesecake

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Make a nigga bitch tap out
Then put 24’s on a real big body
Bitch said nigga need to stop got 100 racks on me
Can't fit in my pocket
I'm a street nigga, I'ma eat me some soup, I'ma let my bitch eat pasta
Told y'all niggas ain't stopping
Black card in my wallet, I'ma feed my partner
I was at one of my shows feeling like Cam'ron with the pink Margielas
We was tryna beat a murder capital, riding around the town with the pink Beretta
When I got in touch with the money, me and shawty fucked around and filled my schedule
Momma just sent me a picture got Indian in my family through my God damn nana
Young nigga fucked 'round, dropped out school, learned it all through the ID channel
Young nigga fucked around and ran out of bullets in the .40, got to get a banana
These young niggas go brazy, done got that money, they still might pop
So many blue faces on me right now, young nigga still gamble
35 racks for the factories, I steal mammals
I ain't no rapper nigga, I geolog'
I'm a big dog, no pedigree, I eat racks
Boomerang your bitch sweet, she coming back

When that money gonna show up?
Thought that 10 Day shit would blow up
Got you stressed, ripping your 'fro up
Smokin' squares, fuckin' your throat up
And a nigga from your iPod in the party and they know ya
And your teachers wanna claim ya, they critically acclaim ya
Used to criticize your mistakes, "Mr. Bennett's Mr. Famous"
Mrs. Rownd just heard your mixtape, "the misogynistic mischief"
You the reason for the mishaps, and should keep coming up missing
You're a top dog; you the top, dog
They can't even catch up; you so hot, dog
And it feels good, and it feels dope
You still steal shit, cause you still broke
And you really wanna drop, really really hot
Shit that they really wanna cop, but they wouldn't give a fuck
If you won a Grammy, if you end up in the Hall of Rock
Then you end up in a hole from a hammy to the top
Got 99 problems, got a 100 to the drugs
I should finish up this verse, but you know I don't give a fuck
YOLO!

[Hook]
Yo-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, YOLO (x5)

[Verse 2]
Shouts out my juice, bitch, my cup runneth over
Bout now them suits fit, my cuffs button golden
So bitch suck my dick, igh, bitch, suck my dack
I been riding 'round in that steamer with that steamer in my lap
I swear I used to give a fuck, but now I give a fuck less
What do I think of success? What do you think of fuck fest?
You ever had a foursome? You ever been a suspect?
You ever passed the fuck out? You ever failed a drug test?
I learned from getting bumped that bumping Ye could make it be okay
All that jumping, dunking shit can't make a 3 go way
I been up inside the stu' for fucking three whole days
Yelling, "Fuck the cops, it ain't nothing to box"
So somebody pour me another shot like SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS
SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, Drop, drop, drop, drop
Give a fuck, fuck that-that Is you going, dot, dot, dot?
Like a lot, lot, lot, lot, do the fop, bop, bop, bop
Don't stop, stop, stop, stop

[Hook][Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Chance, acid rapper, soccer, hacky sacker
Cocky khaki jacket jacker
Slap-happy faggot slapper, bah-bah!
Iraqi rocket launcher
Shake that Laffy Taffy, jolly raunchy rapper
Dang, dang, dang, skeet, skeet, skeet
She do that thing for three retweets
The album feel like '92
Now take that ball 'fore he three-peat
Chance, ho, acid, cruising on that LSD
Asked Joseph about my deal
He looked back said, "Hell yeah, let's eat!"

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words
But I still fuck with you, you just ain't never heard
It go like: count that stack, pop that cap then down that Jack
All my niggas hit that xan, and all my ladies bob that back
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm bout that jam

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Young Rascal Flatts, young ass kid ass could rap
Fuck all the faculty, tobacco-packing acrobat
Back-to-back packin' bags back and forth with fifths of Jack and
Fourths of weed, I'm back to pack on hands
With young Cletus to pat my back
Real nigga with a nose ring, that's right
Just here to rap them songs
Rag on my hair, wrap weed in Vegas, rockin' Vagabonds
Sang a song, oh you don't know? What?
Well, I still bang with you
Hang with you, sip drank with you
As long as I can sang with you like:

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words

This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm bout that jam

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
Niggas, please be focused, that Bino, you know this
He rep the home of Sosas, you know I'm from that Zone 6
You know I rep that Stone shit, you know your hood is so clit
As God as my witness, this Will Smith spit real shit
I'ma be that, CG busy gettin', where the weed at?
Bought your girl some new kneepads
You're fuckin' with the Fifi bag
My stars, egad, she said, "This my favorite song"
"Hold my purse" - now she on the floor, droppin' like it's hot
You blast this shit in Abercrombie when your work is finished
Your mom won't play it in the car 'cause it's got cursing in it
Your boy like: "I'm the one who showed you"
He want his percentage
'Cause you were like: "this ain't the nigga you said spittin', is it?"
Two-step, white dude's Harlem Shake
Why you laughing? 'Cause you Harlem Shake
I was never fake, I was just too good to be true
That's acid rap, we killed the track
You had your chance, and 'Bino too, ooh

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & Childish Gambino]
This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words
But I still fuck with you, you just ain't never heard
It go like: count that stack, pop that cap then down that Jack
All my niggas hit that xan, and all my ladies bob that back
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm bout that jam[Produced by Social Experiment]

[Intro: James Blake]
Love is the life 'round here
We're never done

Part time love

[Verse: Chance the Rapper]
Life ain't been 'round here in a minute
Here ain't been 'round my whole life
Mike ain't spin 'round in a minute
The sand just dropped for the last time
But wear that fake smile like a cape
Save yourself first
Light ain't been 'round here in a minute
Darkness been swallowed it up
Chaos been 'round for a minute
Marketed, bottled it up
But wear that fake smile like a cape
Save yourself first
I ain't been 'round here in a minute
But here ain't been round a whole lot
My flesh looked through the peephole
Seen his people, sealed the keyhole and kept the door locked
Life can't be here, indefinite
Not another minute 'round here
Why can't a minute be spent in a town that's nowhere round here?
But wear that fake smile like a cape
But wear that fake smile like a cape
Save yourself first[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
Happy Holidays

[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
She could say in her voice, in her way that she love me
With her eyes, with her smile, with her belt, with her hands, with her money
I am the thesis of her prayers
Her nieces and her nephews are just pieces of the layers
Only ones she love as much as me is Jesus Christ and Taylor
I got a future so I'm singing for my grandma
You singing too, but your grandma ain't my grandma
Mine's is hand made, pan fried, sun dried
Southside, and beat the devil by a landslide
Praying with her hands tied, president of my fan club, saying to her
Something told me I should bring my butt to church

[Hook: Jamila Woods]
You gotta move it slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy

[Bridge: Jamila Woods]
Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
(*Mama you know it's gonna rain*)
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
(*Mama you know it's gonna rain*)

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I come to church for the candy, your peppermints is the truth
I'm pessimistic on Monday if I had tweaked and missed you
You look so good with that hat on, had to match with the shoes
Came and dressed in the satin, I came and sat in your pew
I come to Christmas for dinner, fifty rolls on my plate
Hella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place
I like my love with a budget, I like my hugs with a scent
You smell like light, gas, water, electricity, rent
You sound like why the gospel choir got so tired
Singin his praises daily basis so I gotta try it
You're my dreamcatcher, dream team, team captain
Matter fact, I ain't seen you in a minute let me take my butt to church

[Bridge: Jamila Woods]
Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
(*Mama you know it's gonna rain*)
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
(*Mama you know it's gonna rain*)

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
Mama you know, Mama you know its gonna rain
Father you know
Promised, you said it would rain, finally I'm home
You left on the light when I left on the flight, but I made it alright
I've been waiting all week, I've been waiting all night
Jason Van Dyke
Had to say something on Saturday
See you at Church on Sunday
Open Mike coming on Monday
I wonder what the internet gonna say
When SNL end with the Indie
Then the third tape slide down the chimney
Via Kirsten, Kinsley, Lisa, Kenny, Taylor, Wendy, Austin win the Emmy, Mama Jan too

[Bridge: Jamila Woods]
Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
(*Momma you know it's gone rain*)
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rainTracklist (Click links for lyrics)

Hide yourself
From those you’re born to lead
Kill yourself
Escape from being free
Love, lose yourself
They say you’ll only make it that way

[Verse]
I keep running from who i’m supposed to be
Yearn to fit in with those who’s words choke me
Lies threatening to swallow me whole
I’ll hide myself from me

[Hook]


[Verse]


[Outro]
I’ll hide no longer
I’ll hide no longer
I’ll hide no longer, i am stronger["All We Got" Piano]

I want to extend a very special prayer to my big brother Kanye West. I know there's a lot of weird foo...folks out there. But you already know I'm a hundred grand, and I wanted to extend this prayer, extend this love, extend this love, all the way from Britain. We might come back early to come and see this man. Happy Thanksgiving.

[Verse]
Lazy male
Complainin' 'bout how high school he could
But his ACL
Aye, [?]
You're my daddy, how
You just a uncle from ATL
You better take out that trash
Boy, get your big
Grown ass on
Old ass on
Broke ass drinkin' up all the milk
But can't do no laundry
EHarmony romance on
Watch your tone, folk
Talkin' to grown folk
Yeah, get that bass out your voice
You was soundin' like Tone Loc
Now watch how I move
Different chapters
Decision's mission
Visit pastors
Everybody finally can say it out loud
Your favorite rapper a Christian rapper
And I got faith in my fate
In my soul, in my tape
In the cape, in the drape
From out West to the lake
Then cover his face like a Bape
And I hate when I wait
Never come late
Tobacco back Rolls
To bus seat back rows
To black boy black Rolls
Black Rolls
Men grow just as surely as mountain's peak
And plateaus plateau, you know what I mean?
You just a grown ass kid
Who the fuck you think you is
The sun is only halfway up
You still ain't come out your crib
You just a grown ass boy
Get up out o' here with all that noise
You still ain't come out your crib[Produced by Nate Fox]

[Intro]
Thirsty, thirsty, tryna choose
I mean, I know I'm pretty cool
My Nitty bag, my kitty boost
I got the juice, I got the juice

[Verse 1]
Chano, Chatham's own
Foolies glad I'm home
Even my haters kinda glad I'm on
Rest In Peace to my Vagabond
Rapper song, singer, suspended, subpoena
For misdemeanors, dreamer
Held back ass is lowkey still a senior
And I still shake up BO Squad, praying for my BroBois
City on the come up, shout that nigga Sosa!
Shout my nigga Fat Trel, shout my nigga Joseph
Playing Buenos Aires while they sleepin': buenas noches!
Wonder if I wrote this, 'cause it's so crisp
The most brokest cold stockbroker, winter solstice
I could win an Oscar, Russian accent husky
Acid addict, costly avid actor, Kevin Costner

[Chorus]
Juice! Juice! Juice! Juice!
I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup!)
Juice! Juice! Juice! Juice!
I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup!)

[Verse 2]
God give me one sentence more
Maybe I just gotta get suspended more?
Hashtag it, get mentions for it
Make you love it, get it trending more
And then act humble
Hear some bull that some dude mumble
Wantin' to jump dude, but let that nigga punk you
Knowin' bitch niggas wanna bring guns to the rumbles, IGH!
But I love y'all souls, don't let the juice spill Pac!
Blue pill pop 'til you feel good enough to pop
The popped bitch in the blue heels, yop!
That one, drown in the juice nigga
Hunnid proof get found in a youth nigga
Stop with all the tryna' introduce nigga
Everybody know you dude, you the new nigga!
How's it feel to be you? Yo no sé
I ain't really been myself since Rod passed
I ain't even really need that shop class
I ain't really been weak since pop's smashed
I'm a genius, a mothafuckin' pop smash
Hit sensei, master
Jack and Lindsey, Wiley, Kembe
Been paid, 10 Day been they FAFSA

[Chorus]
Juice! Juice! Juice! Juice!
I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup!)
Juice! Juice! Juice! Juice!
I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup!)

[Verse 3]
Jugo, you never tasted paper
Tripped, racing yaself tryna' chase the paper
I just faced a Veg-er
And you love being Kobe when you make the lay-er
'Til you realize everybody in the world fuckin' hates the Lakers
And then everybody wanna sip
'Til the juice spill, everybody wanna bib
And then everybody wanna dip
Told you I ain't worried, I ain't scared of the booth
All you can do is spit a verse of the truth
Merge the mixture with the purest and the fruits
And the thirst, just the worst, it's the curse of the juice!

[Chorus]
Juice! Juice! Juice! Juice!
I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup!)
Juice! Juice! Juice! Juice!
I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup!)

Everybody wanna lie, that's nice, no
Oh, now you wanna chill, oh, now you wanna build
Oh, now you got the bill, that's cool though
Oh, now you got the gas, oh, now you wanna laugh
Oh, now you need a cab, that's true though
All you do is talk, I ain't got shit to say
Can't no one get in my car, I don't even valet
Long discussions, oh, you my cousin?
No you wasn't, you just wanna ride
You just wanna talk about politics, Chicago shit and rocket ships
(You just wanna, you just wanna, you just wanna, you just wanna, you just wanna, you just wanna)
Shut up! Start dancing, ho

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
You just went and spilt fries in the seat
It's fried on the seat, come ride on the seat, ay
Last girl, she'll lie on the seat, she'll fart on the seat
Now she jog in the streets, say
I don't trust no one faking like a fan, asking for a pic
You should use your phone, call a Uber
You a goofy if you think I don't know you need a Lyft
Is you is or is you ain't got gas money
No IOU's or debit cards, I need cash money
So back up, back up, I need space
Now, I need you to slow down, it's not a race
Now I can't really hear what you gotta say now
Shut up! Start dancing, ho

My bitch do the salsa like pico de gallo
They gotta ask if they may, Cinco de Mayo
How can they call themselves bosses
When they got so many bosses
You gotta see what your boss say
I get it straight out the faucet
I ain't felt like this since the third Drought, third Carter drop
Told my momma third grade I'd be in the third Barbershop

And these bitches gon' fuck off respect and that loyalty
All my bitches lovin' me and they spoil me
Rub me down with that lotion, babe oil me

Change the culture, cause my ring is a solar
Wait one minute I told you

Am I the only one who really care about cover art?
Growing up I ain't have my brother
'Cause he said the streets gave him a fresh start
I ain't know what that mean
I bumped heads with my dean
Dropped out and hit the scene
Now I'm stunting like bling
Time and time again, they told me no
They told me I wouldn't go
'Cause in high school all I cared about was hoes
Well, maybe that shit was my interest
Now I spend more than they make at my dentist
After 1Night the folks thought I was finished
I pinned my name to the game like a seamstress
Oh, bitch I bite like a gator
Fuck them reviews that they put in the paper
Did what I wanted, didn't care about a hater
Delivered my tape to the world as a caterer
Oh, they fuck with me cause I'm different
New sound, new appearance
Bitch, it's Boat from the 6
Give a fuck about a bitch
Walk out, my hand on my dick, I'm the shit

A willow was birthed
It's alright, I wept, I prayed on it, slept on it, wait on it (IGH, IGH!)
Just flame up with Tunechi, you know that you Gucci
Just somethin' to say on it  (huh, huh)

Reese and Justin a phone call away
They say no delay, and ándale! they on the way
Catch me in the city on the Divvy with the kiddies givin' tours to the tourists
Givin' our city to the kids, like givin' flowers to the florist
Need a little scratch but the tours itch
Proud to go where the pot of gold too rich
Grab a couple bucks, take some more with you (huh, huh)

I am a promise, capital "P"

[Verse 1]
Nigga, fuck this whole school and everything you tahm 'bout
Don't ask me for no I.D., bitch I fucking signed out
Bitch I've been suspended, bitch I've been on timeout
Waking up in grind mode and sleeping in a grindhouse
So please don't hit my line 'bout the party trying to find out
What time that shit going to start
Or when it end, or who gone come out
Or if I walked the stage
I've been on stage since I could rhyme out
Shows and shows and tapes
Of trying to get my fucking lines out
So please don't take my BIC out, my book out, my pick out
My hair, my fucking big mouth, you dick head you dipped out
Of class and now you shit out of luck, who fucking slick now
And with them rhymes you written down
I hope you get a mixdown
With a diss track from Ms. Rownd
And my dick sack in this bitch mouth
Give a five-hive to my teacher face
And my principal that fist pound
And now you gotta switch gowns
We caught you, little rascal
We got you throwing tantrums
When you could've thrown a tassel, ahh

[Verse 2]
Nigga, you're a weakling, why you talking dealing?
Like, "All my niggas flip birds!" Nigga, you're a wing-zing
You ain't nothing but my seedling, I'll hang you from the ceiling
And leave yo' little ass leaking, and leave yo' body stinking
Dude, yo' ass been drinking? Or you just wasn't thinking?
I'll hit you with that 6-piece: bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink!
I hear your pockets jingling
It's calling me like "ring, ring!"
I'll choke you with your bling bling
Then run faster than Tink Tink
And all these goofies mad though
Like, "Why he such a asshole?"
And I ain't even mad yo, I'll stab you with a screwdriver
That shit ain't even rhyme nigga
I'm fucked up out my mind nigga
I stay right off the '9 nigga
That's where they try an' find a nigga
Feeling froggy? Better timid up
Harsh feelings gone, put 'em in a blunt
Cause niggas don't wanna get bended up
Stay talking but don’t send it up
Used to send it up for my skinner lunch
Save money niggas really won't spend a buck
Gimme that cash, that ben what up
Pockets keep that denim bruh like ahh

[Chorus]
Nigga, fuck you tahm bout? Fuck you tahm bout?

[Verse]
I'm just a soul that borrowed the bod
I have no quarrel with God
Keep my eye on the sparrow until I'm sparrin' with Rod
I will not spoil when I'm hot
I'm just gon' boil this pot
Moistenin' soil and plant sequoias that's tall enough
That they foil your plot
I am not royalty or giant, just a boy with a rock
Employer of lawyers, boy oh boy, it ain't no boy in me, ma
The work is over, you should sit back and enjoy your seat, ma
I'm buyin' groceries and toys and baby toilet seats, ma
I'm s'posed to teach 'em and feed 'em and give 'em help when they're readin'
And give 'em hugs after beatings and give 'em love after love
I'm Hallmark and Walmart just for you
And if it fall apart or it's all dark, I'm a wall charger or a call card
Or a cab co, or a golf cart just for you
We a ballpark, just the two
You're a Gamestop, I'm a Paul Blart, just not two
Thinkin' back on my rap shit, my mini afro black shit
That na-na-na-na bo squad got my back shit
Nathan, Peter, Nico on my tracks shitSamurai Jack
Kangaroo Jack
Hungry JackEverybody outside, everybody outside
When I pull up outside, all night, no
Everybody high five, everybody wanna smile
Everybody wanna lie, that's nice, no
Oh, now you wanna chill, oh, now you wanna build
Oh, now you got the bill, that's cool though
Oh, now you got the gas, oh, now you wanna laugh
Oh, now you need a cab, that's true though
All you do is talk, I ain't got shit to say
Can't no one get in my car, I don't even valet
Long discussions, oh, you my cousin?
No you wasn't, you just wanna ride
You just wanna talk about politics, Chicago shit and rocket ships
Shut up! Start dancing, ho

All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, hey
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay

You just went and spilt fries in the seat
It's fried on the seat, come ride on the seat, ay
Last girl, she'll lie on the seat, she'll fart on the seat
Now she jog in the streets, say
I don't trust no one faking like a fan, asking for a pic
You should use your phone, call a Uber
You a goofy if you think I don't know you need a lyft
Is you is or is you ain't got gas money
No IOU's or debit cards, I need cash money
So back up, back up, I need space
Now, I need you to slow down, it's not a race
Now I can't really hear what you gotta say now
Shut up!

All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, hey
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay
Start dancing, ho[Intro: Slum Village & (Chance The Rapper)]
Ladies loving my music is like some sex shit
Niggas trying to grip up my mic like it's a dick
(On the mic like it's a dick)
Run around the corner to pick up the new shit (The shit)
Toss this in the deck so niggas can catch rep

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
What's good good? And what's good evil?
And what's good, gangstas? And what's good, people?
And why's God's phone die every time that I call on Him?
If his son had a Twitter wonder if I would follow Him
Swallow them synonyms like cinnamon Cinnabon
Keep all them sentiments down to a minimum
Studious Gluteus Maxim models is sending him
Pics of they genitalia, tallied up ten of 'em
I slurped too many pain-kills down, I'm off a lot
I got a lot off days, but it ain't often that I'm off the clock
Ya kna' wha' mean, I got the Chicago Blues
We invented rock before the Stones got through
We just aiming back 'cause the cops shot you
Buck buck bang bang, yelling "Fuck Fox News!"
Booyaka buckle up, mothafuck opps too
Ain't no knuckling up 'em young 'cause it just not cool

[Bridge: Chance The Rapper]
Nice to see you, Father New Year
Middle finger Uncle Samuel
Shooting death with weighted dice
And hitting stains on birthday candles
I know somebody, somebody loves my ass
'Cause they help me beat my demon's ass

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & BJ the Chicago Kid]
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Right? IGH
I used to tell hoes I was dark light or off-white
But I'd fight if a nigga said that I talk white
And both my parents was black
But they saw it fit that I talk right
With my drawers hid but
My hard head stayed in the clouds like a lost kite
But gravity had me up in a submission hold
Like I'm dancing with the Devil with two left feet and I'm pigeon-toed
In two small point ballet shoes with a missing sole
And two missing toes
But it's love like Cupid kissing a mistletoe

[Bridge: Chance The Rapper]
Nice to see you, Father New Year
Middle finger Uncle Samuel
Shooting death with weighted dice
And hitting stains on birthday candles
I know somebody, somebody loves my ass
'Cause they help me beat my demons ass

[Verse 3: Saba]
Like Cassius ducking the draft and now the fight is over
The type to love from a distance, not the type that told her
Spent three days on the rap, trash it and type it over
With babies on the block underarms like fighting odors
Coppers and quotas, hold ya head like 2Pac had taught
Obviously, they are on a come up
With better chances tobogganing in the fucking summer
Concoctions for the bad days and a condom for the good ones
All odds against us we tryna get lucky, doper than Lucky
You're ending happy, that's only a tugging
Like Satan masturbating shit come hot, but y'all still love me
Ugh, howfFather Time a deadbeat? Maybe I'm adopted
That'll explain why all of my shit been so timeless, IGH

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & BJ the Chicago Kid]
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right[Produced by Peter Cottontale and THEMpeople]

[Verse 1]
I wonder if Gladys smiles when angels bring my name up
Or change language and subject change up
Her boy’s a long way from red dolls and green rangers
Things ain’t been the same since Ms. Patterson called me famous
I saw your reflection in a toilet full of vomit water
You don’t think I felt your hand on my head yelling, “Call his father”
But people don’t hear ghost, so how they gon' play me?
Money saved me, so I’ma do the same thing
You droppin' pounds, gettin' small on some sick shit
Like how you got the drive but don’t know how to use a stick shift?
You better not miss this, overdose dope and mix this
Let your throat close with a boatload of dope quotes within it

[Chorus]
Long time now since I seen you smile
Long time long time now, since I seen you smile
And it's been a long time, long time now
Since I seen you smile

[Verse 2]
Dropping tapes 'till I lost the count
Coughing out blood
Dropping weight like I lost an ounce
Throwing words and tossing nouns
NY traveling, I’m Boston bound, bossing 'round homies
And talking down to shorties while I’m jotting down
Notes to spit to Harlem crowds
Surfing through the Harlem crowds
At the crib I’m falling down
I'm on the floor crawling 'round
I’m calling out to God, "You’re little angel's falling down
Save me from my darkened cloud
Reach your hands and arms around"

[Chorus]
Long time long time now, since I seen your smile
We miss you

[Verse 3]
#10Day
It's been a really, really long time, long time
Since a goof ass nigga done tried me
Label niggas wanna sign me
And lame ol' nigga wanna buy me
Food and weed and drink and shit
Just as long as you inkin' shit
Sometimes I can't pay for food
Cause sometimes I can't think of shit
Where's your head at? Where's your head at?
Singing my shit like you just said that
Wanging my shit like where'd you hear that?
Young ass nigga where you headed? Long time to get famous
Life's whatever you make it, just thank God that we made it[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
I get sad when I look at the stars
They so pretty, you can't tell 'em apart
You think they close but really we far
And really, they ain't even that much closer to God
It's much harder to sin naked
I walked past apple trees and didn't take it
I thought about stone mattresses, thin blankets
Really long winters spent in a windbreaker
I'm a temptation door-knocker, down there on Lower Wacker
I'm a rich excuse for a father, you just can't tour a toddler
She turnin' 2, she don't need diapers, she just need her papa
I really need a break, could really use a nap
My daughter barely recognize me when I lose the hat
You go so far, you hit a point where you can't Uber back
The other day, I told a hummingbird he too relaxed
I did my worst, I did the work, I had to skip the label
I go to church, they want a flick, I want to flip the table
I knew the worth before the birth when it was just a stable
And now it's just a fable, and it's just as fatal

[Pre-Chorus 1: Chance The Rapper]
First world problems that niggas make up
Have a dream and then never wake up
When so much turns to too much
Have a dream and then never wake up

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & Daniel Caesar]
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes, here it comes, yeah
Ready or not, ready or not
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes, here it comes
Ready or not, here it comes

[Bridge: Chance The Rapper]
Here it comes
Alright
Spirit's working now

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
I think my little cousins want they cousin back
The automatic quarterback that doesn't rap
They know I used to drive to Hammond for the Roman candles
Lied about coming back, the last straw that broke the camel
It ain't really fun to hang out with me no more
We can't go to River East to hang at the beach no more
It's messed up, I made it this way, and my feet so sore
But it's all downhill from here, I could teach snowboards
I miss my mom, I miss my time, I miss my prime
In high school, I missed my prom, I ditched my date, I missed my beat
Kissed my teeth, kicked my feet, hooped and hollered
Now I just sip my tea, sit my ass on my ass
Send my tweet, fold my arms, twist my weed
If I hadn't heard the news, I would've known what he say
But the recliner on my chair is like an emergency brake, you know

[Pre-Chorus 1: Chance The Rapper]
First world problems that niggas make up
Have a dream and then never wake up
When so much turns to too much
Have a dream and then never wake up

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & Daniel Caesar]
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes, here it comes
Ready or not, ready or not
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes
Ready or not, here it comes

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
Three verses, hell yes
I still ain't get my Grammys in the mail yet
I just want my mama happy like a toy sale
And to stay connected to the world like a long-ass voicemail
I hear the seams snappin', and I'm the team captain
No more knee slappin' or shoe shinin' or shoe signin'
'Til the dream happens, I'm just gon' keep rappin'
And y'all just keep clappin' and keep actin' like
Flint got clean water and y'all don't got teen daughters
And black friends and gay cousins, y'all just gon' say nothin'
Know that the day comin', knees bowed, tongues confessin'
The last ones gettin' first dibs on blessings

[Pre-Chorus 2: Chance The Rapper]
Now these the first world problems that niggas make up
Keep on playin', we gon' shake this shit up
Keep on tellin' us we makin' it up
The American Dream, may you never wake up

[Outro: Chance The Rapper & Daniel Caesar]
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes,  ready or not, ready or not
Ready or not,  ready or not, ready or not
The day is on its way, it will not wait another day
No more, no more (it's on its way, way, yeah)
The day is on its way, I cannot wait, here it's to stay
No more, no more (it won't wait, yeah)
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it is[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
Mmm, IGH!
Acid Rap!

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
I don't even talk to them on the phone again
Leave in the AM, on the road again
So bitch, let's fuck so I can smoke again
I gotta smoke again, I got shit to do
I don't even talk to them on the phone again
Leave in the AM, on the road again
So bitch, let's fuck so I can smoke again
I gotta smoke again, I got shit to do

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Who smokin' in my car? it's that nigga Chano
AKA Mr. Bennett,   AK Tony Montano
I've got some folks in low end, I got some folks in C-note
AK hundred dinero, you ever seen Casino?
I just got back with 'Bino, I got a bitch but she know
Her friends done did the Dino, that's that Chicago lingo
Flamin' hots with cheese, and a Kiwi Mistic
My dick won't even call her, cause she left all that lipstick
Niggas be on dirt, that's why I stay on petty
I know that bangers jam, that's why my hands stay ready
Flip the candy yum, that's the fucking bombest
Lean all on the square, that's a fuckin' rhombus

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
I don't even talk to them on the phone again
Leave in the AM, on the road again

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Who's sneaking in the club? that's that young sir rapper
Un-saran wrap the purple, wrap that blunt under after
Smoke all out the window, cops could eat a dick
If you ain't the hitter, you just might be the lick
Flame on, flame on, I'm your bitch's ringtone
She like when I rap raps, but better when I sing songs
No Drake, but I get my Trey on, killin' in the hood like Trayvon
Shoppin' like I got a coupon, savin' like I got a cape on
Cookin' crack in my apron, dressed like a nigga had 8 proms
Tell shorty I may change and I made it and I napalm
Trippy shit to watch drugs while on the clock
Acid on the face that's a work of art

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
I don't even talk to them on the phone again
Leave in the AM, on the road again
So bitch, let's fuck so I can smoke again
I gotta smoke again, I got shit to do
I don't even talk to them on the phone again
Leave in the AM, on the road again
So bitch, let's fuck so I can smoke again
I gotta smoke again, I got shit to do
I don't even talk to them on the phone again
Leave in the AM, on the road again
So bitch, let's fuck so I can smoke again

I don't even talk to them on the phone again
Leave in the AM, on the road again
So bitch, let's fuck so I can smoke again
I gotta smoke again, I got shit to do

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Soulo hoe hoe twerk somethin'
Throw it back like you tryna hurt somethin'
I'm so def, I ain't ever heard nothin'
My name Herb, take herb, smoke herb (say word?)
How 'bout you? No dap, but I'll take a pound or two
No doubt like Gwen Stefani's group
Look, let me put my mouth where you potty, boo (IGH!)
Them niggas pissed, need potty training
They movement shit, that's a potty train
She ain't left yet, but she probably came
We kicked it then I score, soccer game
She was a phony goalie, I got great aim though, don't insult me
I'll give it to ya straight, this is what she told me
My name Soulo, 'cause I'm the one and only
She only got you as a nigga on the side
That's a nigga on the side of a side bitch, homie
Then we got out a Dodge, like them Dukes of Hazzard
Music and tabs of Lucy, take your chance with this rapper

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
I don't even talk to them on the phone again
Leave in the AM, on the road again
So bitch, let's fuck so I can smoke again

I've got a lady, a lady friend
I've got a lady friend
I've got a lady and that lady is my
I've got a lady, I've got, I've got a lady
And that lady is my friend
I've got, I've got a lady for a friend

[Verse]
I'm your buddy, I'm your little bro
I'm a stuffed animal
I'm a cuddle, not a dildo
I'm a love anecdote
Was I always taller than ya?
Will I always call ya back?
I'mma always wrongly answer
Always almost caught ya trap
Imaginary beneficiary been—
Away for so long, Ben & Jerry friend
Few compliments and a tear wipe
I'm the best man you're not marrying
And you know they ask about you
"What's up with your lady?"
I tell 'em, "You're just, you're just
You're just gorgeous"
You're just a lady friend, a lady friend

For a friend, for a friend
What would you do?
For for a friend
What would you do for a friend?Lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned![Produced by MF Love]

[Intro]
"He should try enjoying life, rather than spending his time trying to outsmart me. While he's alive, that is"

"I know what you're saying but it's not that simple, it's just human nature"

"What's that guy doing, I wonder?"

[Verse 1]
I still got orange and white cassette tapes
Tents where my neighbor came to spectate
Niggas that’s tough now used to get little in the dark
It’s all cool now, we’re all little kids at heart
Accident prone Chance, y'all remember 'bout
The time I cracked my head open at Auntie Linda’s House
From diapers to outfits to castles to Elmos
From Santas to Grandmas to Gameboys and cell phones
Rocked your world, fourth grade talent show
Jada and Justin’s birthday magic show
Games of tips taking niggas to school
Two quarters and I’ll bust your ass at pool, on bull
Round here we lose best friends like every week
I like to think we playin' a long game of hide and go seek
And one day maybe I’ma find Terrance and I could lead them
Kids of the Kingdom singing about freedom

[Chorus]
Heads down, eyes shut, time to play Seven Up
Heads bowed, hands clutched, bottles gone, Heavens up
Smiles come through, though my eyes might cry
When they reminisce over you, my God

[Verse 2]
Let’s take it back like Indian givers
To Indian burns and Jiminy Crickets
To the smell of Pillsbury on biscuit mornings
To puffy winter coats and Christmas mornings
I used to chill with the kids next door
And SpongeBob came around 'bout four
And then I’d hang with Bart’s guys
Around the bend was Smart Guy
Flipping through the picture books
Checking through my archives
Remember the old days, the ones you’ll never get back
At the end of parties, passing around gift bags
Now we blow entire O's at one kick back
MY$FITS and mismatch that get off like wrist slaps, uhh

[Chorus]
Heads down, eyes shut, time to play Seven Up
Heads bowed, hands clutched, bottles gone, Heavens up
Smiles come through, though my eyes might cry
When they reminisce over you, my God
When they reminisce over you, my God

[Verse 3]
Remember Jeepers and Odyssey Fun World
Young pimpin' like you oughta see one girl
Mama Jann, mama Charlie, and my mama Lisa
Booster seat used to boost my kitty, Connie's Pizza
And every year we made a Christmas list
And Auntie Linda cooked a Christmas dish
And all of our grandparents made a Christmas wish
Like “Lord, let me see another year like this”, uhh

[Chorus]
Heads down, eyes shut, time to play Seven Up
Heads bowed, hands clutched, bottles gone, Heavens up
Smiles come through, though my eyes might cry
When they reminisce over you, my God
When they reminisce over you, my God[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
Chance, acid rapper, soccer, hacky sacker
Cocky khaki jacket jacker
Slap-happy faggot slapper
Iraqi rocket launcher
Shake that Laffy Taffy, jolly raunchy rapper
Bang, bang, bang - skeet, skeet, skeet
She do that thing for three retweets
The album feel like '92
Now take that ball 'fore he three-peat
Chance, ho, acid head, cruising on that LSD
Asked Joseph about my deal
He looked back said "hell yeah, let's eat!"
Young Rascal Flatts - Young ass kid ass could rap
Fuck all the assholes, asterisk back
I'm like a nazi not dead to be dad
Gratzi for all of the shots that we had
The shots that we had, i'm tryna take another fucking shot on the ave
Shoutsout the ave
Shouts to all my niggas from Chicago and Laramie
Let em hear it if they haven't hear of me they scared of me
Im outie IGH!

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I'm off the top like a confiscated hat
They took it back like we confiscating that
Can i get it, wait i'm skating back
Down the rail
Tell him if he's ever been to hell, holy grail
That all these niggas looking for
I ain't looking forward to a magazine
Or a cover of Forbes
I don't need to afford
A Ford car that I could ride through switch on the doors
Turn up the locks because niggas be trying to rob you
I don't really hear shit they trying to rock through
They trying to rock through the rock of gilbraltar
I had to take the shit to the alter
And alter my shit like control-alt-delete
I know i'm hot in the streets
And i'm hot with the tweets
And i'm hot with the heat
And i'm like the spurs vs the heat
First verse, worse than me
And everybody's wishing happy birthday
Like wheres the candles
And wheres that nigga chano?
And wheres that nigga that eats like campbells
Camp full of soup...

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
You a lame and your bitch break down my weed sometimes
See my face in the streets, in the tweets if you read sun times
I be in the sun times if you read one time
I hit it then i hit one time
Every time i drop a hit and niggas like it
Everybody want to rap just like it
And i know that my rap just might fix the game
Shoutsout to swane shoutsout to swayne
Lahni, ripping of the top i got a trumpet, Donnie
Shoutsout that nigga Nico
I gotta meet those
Girls that be giving me pesos and euros and lethos
You understand it if you write a few papers
Off of the top i'm blowing vapors
Throw it to my homie with the light saber
Cut it up quickly, Ripley's believe me
I be getting off like this is my stop
Heheheh a nigga might stop
If i hit enough hot bars in a row
But if not, i just might give and go
Green light, i got T like a nigga that have a cup of tea right in front of em
I keep bumping em, damn they keep bumping em
Walking through the streets like man we can't bump with em
Having fun with em
Shoutsout sway
Shoutsout everybody in the room today
I'ma be back on the rap fix
And now i gotta act like... an actress[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid, Peter Cottontale, Lili K., Kiara Lanier & (Chance the Rapper)]
Even better than I was the last time baby
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
(Yo, we back)
I'm good, ooh, yeah, I'm good
Even better than I was the last time baby
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, I'm good
(We back and we back and we back)
So good...
(And we back and we back and we back and we back)
Even better than I was the last time

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Rap just make me anxious, and acid made me crazy
Them squares just made me looser and that wax just made me lazy
And I still make this song, and I'ma make another
If you ever actually hit me, better watch out for my brother
Better bet I'd take that deal, gotta watch out for my mother
Get a watch with all that glitters, come in clutters, different colors
Ben-a-Baller, Benford, butlers, chauffeurs, hit a stain-er, did I stutter?
Did a ton of drugs and did better than all my Alma mater
Motherfucker money dance, hundreds xan, gallon lean
Make a joke 'bout Leno's hair then piggyback on Fallon's spleen
Balancing on sporadicity and fucking pure joy
Nightly searches for a bed and I just came off tour with Troy
But I can't complain, I got some motherfucking bitches
How many lab partners have I fucked since I got suspended?
Mr. Bennett, you done did it, you did it, you did it
You did a good ass job, you did a good ass job
And I'm good

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid, Peter Cottontale, Lili K., & Kiara Lanier]
Even better than I was the last time baby
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, I'm good
I'm good, so good...
Even better than I was the last time baby
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'm good (Even better than I was the last time)
So good...

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Work, work, work, work, bang nigga, bang
Twerk, twerk, merge, swerve, dang, pick a lane
Flip a bird; pigeon, plane, it's a word, it's a shame
But God I'm good, swear I couldn’t be better
Kicking dirt on the shirts of the lames
Keep a tab on my exes, keep some "x" on my tongue
Keep my work out in Texas, that's just me flexing my lungs
See them showing they teeth, that's just them flapping they gums
If they bite and I'm snapping, clap clap collapsing they lungs
Call me Chancelor The Rapper, please say, "The Rapper"
Magical word (poof), please say 'Kadabra
Replay the replays; Green Bay, the Packers
Cremate your teammates and freebase the ashes
Matches to gas leaks, dusted dusk 'til dawn
It's just us, and trust ya bottom, bitch, my stuff the fucking bomb
I'm the motherfucking fucker, fuck a niggas fucking dumb
This your favorite fucking album, I ain't even fucking done
I'm good! IGH!

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid, Peter Cottontale, Lili K., & Kiara Lanier]
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, I'm good
Ooh, yeah, I'm good, so good (I'm good, I'm good)
Even better than I was the last time baby
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
(I'm better than the last time, yeah, yeah)
I'm good (I'm gonna be)
So good...

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
They ain't teaching taxes in school
It don't even matter, I was acting a fool
But who would think the raps would turn into racks?
Don't matter, matter fact, it could happen to you
Scars on my head, I'm the boy who lived
The boy love playing when the boy too sick
Reclining on a prayer, I'm declining to help
I've been lying to my body can't rely on myself oh no
Last year got addicted to Xans
Started forgetting my name and started missing my chance
L.A. for four months, end up leaving right back
I'm in love with my city, bitch, I sleep in my hat
I felt hogtied ever since my dog died
He lived to 84, damn, that's a long ride
I know he up there he just sit and he wait
I'll be racing up the stairs I'mma get to the gate singing

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Hey! Gimme the water, gimme the water
I need the kind from Space Jam
Get this money, get this budget, KOK to day camp
Me and my girl plan to stay to the end
Hope there never come a day where we be better as friends
We in a marathon we could build a marriage on
Arguments as parents digging deeper than a baritone
I've been getting blocked just trying to make songs with friends
Labels told me to my face that they own my friends
I got to pray I got to pray, like Hammer after “2 Legit”
I got the power I could poke Lucifer with crucifix
I cannot scrap the stupid shit, I stand up like I'm Ludacris
I know some folks that talk so much
You'd think they drive an Uber whip
Damn, queen said, "Why we in a queen bed?"
I said, "It's yours, don't worry little bean head"
I'm just here to catch my breath, I got a world tattoo
She said, "Cool, just bring me some food"

[Hook: T-Pain]
Oh! All my days
I prayed and prayed
And now I see the finish line
Oh I'm gonna finish mine, yeah
All my days

Part 2: Drown

[Intro: Eryn Allen Kane]
The water may be deeper than it's ever been

[Verse 1: Noname]
Lord rain down on me so I can move on water
Like children at the altar, like God inside my house
I love you, I love you, you looking holy like Mama
You made a church out of feathers, so when she fly to the Father
She know the choir gon' follow and all the offering paid
She gave my name away, to your holy house
She like my blessings in disguise
She likes her Jesus mountain high
So He can watch her lonely child, I know my God
I know my God seen His breaks and His edges
Are jagged for giving that pain to His city in gold
Like everything is everything
Like all them days He prayed with me
Like emptiness was tamed in me
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love

[Chorus: Choir]
Never, never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown

[Verse 2: Choir & Kirk Franklin]
Never, never, never! (Chance, let me in, come onin)
This thirst in my soul (There's a thirst in my soul, it tell me)
Where else can I go? (where?) but You? (come on)
I may cry a river (I may cry a thousand tears)
But You take each drop and You wash (You wash me new)
Me new (people sing)
This water is deep (yes, yes and I need You to)
Jesus rescue me (come on, save me, I need You to)
Take me to Your mountain (hallelujah)
So someday Chicago will be free (someday we'll all be free)
Be free (say!)

[Chorus: Choir]
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
She could say in her voice
In her way that she love me
With her eyes, with her smile
With her belt, with her hands, with her money
I am the thesis of her prayers
Her nieces and her nephews are just pieces of the layers
Only ones she love as much as me is Jesus Christ and Taylor
I got a future so I'm singing for my grandma
You singing too, but your grandma ain't my grandma
Mine's hand made, pan fried, sun dried
Southside, and beat the devil by a landslide
Praying with her hands tied, president of my fan club, Santa
Something told me I should bring my butt to church

[Chorus: Jamila Woods & Chance the Rapper]
You gotta move it slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you you're my Sunday candy
You gotta move it slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you you're my Sunday Candy
Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
You better come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I come to church for the candy, your peppermints is the truth
I'm pessimistic on Monday if I had tweaked and missed you
You look so good with that hat on, had to match with the shoes
Came and dressed in the satin, I came and sat in your pew
I come to Christmas for dinner, fifty rolls on my plate
Hella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place
I like my love with a budget, I like my hugs with a scent
You smell like light, gas, water, electricity, rent
You sound like why the gospel got so tired
Singin' his praises daily basis so I gotta try it
You're my dreamcatcher, dream team, team captain
Matter fact, I ain't seen you in a minute let me take my butt to church

[Chorus: Jamilla woods & (Chance the Rapper)]
You better come on in this house
(Come on in this house)
Cause it's gonna rain
(It's gonna rain)
Rain down Zion
(Rain down)
Cause it's gonna rain
(It's gonna rain)
You better come on in this house
(Come on in this house)
Cause it's gonna rain
(It's gonna rain)
Rain down Zion
(Rain down, IGH!)
It's gonna rain

[Chorus: Jamila Woods & (Chance the Rapper)]
You gotta move it slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you you're my Sunday Candy
You gotta move it slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you you're my Sunday Candy
Slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you you're my Sunday Candy
You better come on in this house
(Come on in this house)
Cause it's gonna rain
(It's gonna rain)
Rain down Zion
(Rain down)
It's gonna rain

You better come on in this house
(Come on in this house)
Cause it's gonna rain
(Its gonna rain)
Rain down Zion
(Rain down)
It's gonna rainScreaming burn it down!
Too loud, too dank, for you to turn it down
Bad bitches running round like shirtless now
Shits just perfect now
When it's worth it why the fuck would I get nervous now
So shop with me on Mary
And fuck with me on Sherrif
Puttin' caramel On Garretts
Yellin' "Fuck the heat on Derrick"
I'm a city based N-word
27's, port's and spirit's
Been trying to share that dinner
Can't inherit from your parents
Igh
I was rollin' a blunt when I wrote this
I was smoking a blunt when I spoke this
Hocus Pocus
Hows that for a smoke trick
Couldn't pay attention
Now I can afford focus
Got a lil' Buzz and they got fuckin' bogus
Like how you swat a flying locust?
But it's actually dope...
Acid, adderol and adjectives
An adolescent I could fuck with?
Igh's his fuckin' Ad-lib?
Burn Burn
City we built
You already forgot the names
Of kids that we killed
Burn Burn
It's hot as all fuck
Cause everyone got burner
Cause it's always gettin' buck

Don't do me I'm an Internet Explorer, Internet Explorer, Internet Explorer
Don't do me I'm an Internet Explorer

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Don't do me I'm an Internet Explorer
Shots like Jordan, I'm sorry
I'm soarin, with these J's that I found
While in the net, surfin'
Those the same color of the last name of Gordon
But these likes that I'm scorin', are way more important
Dude I'm a Mac, what the fuck's your Dell?
Don't be mad at how my wardrobe excels
Word, lookin' for a deal how much I spend yo?
Trust me being fresh, it opens new windows
I'm always fresh and I'm always stuntin'
You're pissed cause I'm fresher than the F5 button
I'm dressed fresh, at the click of a start
After this song I'mma add a few Grammys to my cart
Woah

[Hook]
Don't do me I'm an Internet Explorer, Internet Explorer, Internet Explorer
Don't do me I'm an Internet Explorer

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Hey yo I'm straight off the Netscape
Head to the internet
Log on MySpace, ask the where the women at?
I guess I'm just that type of dude
When I'm at the rest you can catch me on the web like spider food
A pair a nike shoes, nice and new
I got it cuffin' and you other niggas feet bare, like blue
Pretty girls, I keep 'em in bed like the flu
You niggas following, instead we write the rules
Sayin' Mac's 90, and infrared like Sniper 2s
Inside the booth you're recyclin'
It's proof that you dudes can't handle, like unicycles
We fantasy ballin' I'm using Michael
And I can't even call it, but if I had to choose a title
I'd say don't do me I'm an internet explorer

I hate my bed, I hate my home, I hate my job
I hate the wife, I hate the kids, I hate the dog
I hate the sun, I hate the rain, I hate the clouds
I hate the TV, hate the dinner, hate the couch
I hate the car, I hate the bus, I hate the road
I hate the bar, I hate to drink, I hate to smoke
I hate a stranger, hate his boss, I hate his friend
I hate the womb, I needed room, I ate my twin
I hate my hands, handshakes, pancakes, milkshakes
Child-resistant locks on the pill case
I hate inflation, hate the store, I hate to choose
I hate the war, I hate the poor, I hate the news
I hate the late, I can't be early, hate to wait
I hate my lovers cause the way they suffocate
I fuck to hurt, it hurt to date, I hate to date
I fuck to hate, I hate to love, I hate to hate

[Verse 2]
I hate to lose, I hate to try, I hate to win
I hate to cruise, I hate to fly, I hate to swim
I hate the optimistic smirks on the face of children
I hate the government and those who deface its buildings
I hate artists, hate creatives, I hate bright people
I hate darkness, I hate racists, I hate white people
I hate small speakers, I hate loud speakers
I hate great concerts, I don't like crowds neither
I hate money, I hate change, I hate hope
I hate funny, I hate strange, I hate dope
I hate charities and parodies and tragedies
I hate carrots, peas, asparagus
Virtually all vegetables, circuses, all festivals
Texts that are oversexual, motion because it's perpetual
I hate schedules, calendars, reminders cause' they just remind us That tomorrow gon' be just as timeless
I fuckin' hate you

Smoke like a sailor, curse like a chimney
My pops in the mirror, Mufasa is in me

Reesey and Justin a phone call away (That's right)
They say don't delay, and andale, they on the way (Igh!)
Catch me in my city on the daily with the kiddies givin' tours to the tourists (Mhmm)
Givin' our city to the kids, like givin' flowers to the florist
Pay the little skirt with the torn stitch, [?] with a pot of gold tourist

You should use your phone, call a Uber
You a goofy if you think I don't know you need a lyft
Is you is or is you ain't got gas money
No IOU's or debit cards, I need cash money
So back up, back up, I need space
Now, I need you to slow down, it's not a race
Now I can't really hear what you gotta say now

IGH![Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
Fuck with me y'all
I mean either way you stuck with me y'all
I'm coming at these rap niggas first
And for most that's unluckily y'all
Better know it
Just a mustard seed dog that I ever really needed
Nigga's just tryna see Jesus
Sipping water like it come with different cheeses
All of your opinions facetious, it's feces
I got a thesis or slick dissertation
Our entire species is young and impatient and passive
All at the same damn time, why? Chi to kill them with kindness
Hit them with the Visine, try to cure the blindness
Couple coffee beans for the sinus
Folgers the best part of waking up
Is the alignment of self with God, and that isn't for a selfish heart
My intention was to flood the scene
I don't ever really hug the scene
Y'all know I been submarine with this shit
Little more Actavis how I lean with this shit
Black as hell, still the cream of this crop
With dream, no king just Ving Rhames with six shots
It's the dawn of the dead and I feel so alive
And the free been in here you can tell by my mind, like

[Hook: Arima Ederra]
You just a grown ass kid, who the fuck do you think you is?
The sun is only half way risen, you haven't come out your crib
You just a grown ass boy, get up out of here with all that noise
You ain't ever gonna find no joy playin' yourself like a toy, you just a...
You just a grown ass kid, who the fuck do you think you is?
The sun is only half way up, you steady talking that shit
You just a grown ass boy, get up out of here with all that noise
You ain't ever gonna find no joy playin' yourself like a toy, you just a...

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Lazy male complaining about how in high school he could, but his ACL
Ay be clear, this my daddy house, you just the uncle from ATL
(Better take out that trash)
Boy get your big....grown ass on
Old ass home, broke ass drinking up all the milk
But can't do no laundry, e-Harmony romance on
Watch your tone folk, talking to grown folk
Yeah, yeah, get that bass out your voice, you were sounding like Tone Lōc
Now watch how I move, different chapters
Decisions, missions, visit pastors
Everybody finally can say it out loud, "My favorite rapper a Christian rapper"
And he got fate in his faith in his soul
And a tape, and a cape and that drape from out west
To the lake and it cover his face like a Bape
And I hate when I wait but it never come late
From tobacco back roads to bus seat back rows
A Black boy, black rose, back rolls
Men grow just as surely as mountains peak and plateaus plateau, ya kna wha' mean?

[Hook: Arima Ederra]
You just a grown ass kid, who the fuck do you think you is?
The sun is only half way risen, you haven't come out your crib
You just a grown ass boy, get up out of here with all that noise
You ain't ever gonna find no joy playin' yourself like a toy
Boy you just a...

[Verse 3: Alex Wiley]
Kinda crazy how it fall up in your lap right?
Shit was determined in a past life
If you ask nicely, mad, nice
Even with mad lights you couldn't see the boy
Up in class like I'm only half right, they ain't believe the boy
Wave when you pass them, moments you should bask in
Wonder if the Lord's on my side, let me ask him, or ask her
I don't need a password, don't ask about my past word
Living until my last words, wondering if this music got the slash in
Don't forget the cash and mix in with the passion, oh
If I don't feel the love then I'mma pass end
Shit is everlasting, I'mma have a blast and uh
I'mma have a good day, I'mma stay zonin'
I might get high as shit or I might stay sober
Might roll a J and I might just pass it
Might hit the Bay and I might trip acid
They tried to treat us like some bummy little sneakers
I tell 'em "When you dream, make sure that you dream big"
You could be cool and an Uber driver
The next minute you in Aruba, you scuba divin'
I hope they sell you the truth and that you survivin'
Don't do how they gon' scrutinize 'em
And looking at the youth, tryna euthanize 'em
If it was up to you they would nuke the projects

[Outro: Ha Ha Davis]
Get up off that bed, big fella
You a grown boy, big fella
You need your diaper change, big fella
You still catching a bus nigga and living at mom's crib, big fella
You been tryna get money
You only got ten singles in your pocket, big fella
Get up now, big fella, find you a job
Still playing Xbox 360, you ain't even got an Xbox One
You got a PS one and an Xbox 360, big fella
Go find you a job, today, right now, big fella
The sun is almost gone, big fella
Get up now, big fella
(...playin' yourself like a toy
Boy you just a...)
Get up, big fella
What is you doing?
You been sleeping all day, big fella
You ain't even got no pillows or no cover or no sheets on your bed, big fella
It's time to find another hustle, big fella
That scamming ain't cutting it, big fella
Get up now
Get up, get up, get up, big fella[Hook]
Shawty, she got the body
She did the molly
Probably gonna do the squaddy
Right after papi
Sloppy, she extra choppy
Just did the potty

Probably gonna do the squaddy
Right after papi
Sloppy, she extra choppy
Just did the potty
I love that bitch, the perfect thottie

[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
You are the prototype
I love you like you love your photo likes
When you post your life
Some of these hoes just wanna Instagram me
You out here trying to win you an Instagrammy
Instant pancakes in the morning
Aunt Jemima try to Andre Benjamin me
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson, but your daughter do dicks
Wouldn't be my old bitch if you taught her new tricks
But she do do the one thing, with her tongue ring
When she bust like a gun range
I had a couple pics, record her out her panties
But, that's just chump change
She the type of bitch that loves to say she's mixed
But when she say the roster she always say "Black last"
You know who you is and you know what it is
I love you with your black ass
You helpless thing, wish you gave me more head
And have way more self esteem
But I wish she gave me way more head
Way more then I ever gave a fuck about your self esteem

[Hook]
Shawty, she got the body
She did the molly
Probably gonna do the squaddy
Right after papi
Sloppy, she extra choppy
Just did the potty
I love that bitch, the perfect thottie
The perfect thottie

She did the molly
Probably gonna do the squaddy

Just did the potty
I love that bitch, the perfect thottie
The perfect thottie

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Got it locked, I got lots of keys
Fuck nigga don't start with me
Oh my god, oh my god I’m a novelty
At least that’s what she said when she swallowed menovelty
Your bitches had the ball, my bitches pass the ball
And this dick is a gift for that love degree, hey
Heard you graduating, girl congratulations
This ain't prom but can I take you home as if your fam was waiting
At the front door with that 44 cocked

[Hook]
Shawty, she got the body

Kid: "I'd like to know what you're going to do when you retire from boxing?"
Ali: "I really don't know, I want to say something right here this might make you all think. When I get out of Boxing or when I'm through, I want to do all I can to help people. What's the best thing I can do? Get ready to meet God."

[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
Back in time
I lost track of time
Rolling on the road
Christmas Eves and Valentines
Seemed like the days before
I came I went I did well
I did I really meant well
But I almost missed my beat
So thank you for saving me a seat

[Bridge: Chance the Rapper]
I swear ain't no where greater
Ain't no where brighter
Ain't no where better, better, better, better
Ain't no one prettier
Ain't no one wiser
Ain't no where better, better

[Muhammad Ali]
God is watching me
God don’t praise me because I beat Joe Frazier
God don’t give nothing about Joe Frazier
God don’t care nothing about England or America
As far as wealth
It’s all his
He wants to know how do we treat each other
How do we help each other

[Chorus: Chance the Rapper + Choir]
I was a rock
I was a rock and roller
Back in my day (Back in my day)
But now I'm just a rock (I was a rock)
I was a rock and roller
Back in my day (Back in my day)
But now I'm just a rock
I was a rock

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Steady hold
I've grown weary and old
We're as close as we'll ever be
I was gone I had places to be
And of course you're in the last place I look

[Bridge: Chance the Rapper]
I swear ain't no where greater
Ain't no where brighter
Ain't no where better, better, better, better
Ain't no one prettier
Ain't no one wiser
Ain't no one better, better

[Pre-Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
And I'm still standing here
Standing still
I won't be moved
How used to do when

[Chorus: Chance the Rapper + Choir]
I was a rock
I was a rock and roller
Back in my day (Back in my day)
But now I'm just a rock (I was a rock)
I was a rock
I was a rock and roller
Back in my day (Back in my day)
But now I'm just a rock
I was a rock (I was a rock)
I was a rock and roller
Back in my day (Back in my day)
But now I'm just a rock (I was a rock)
I was a rock and roller
Back in my day (Back in my day)
But now I'm just a rock
I was a rock[Verse: Chance The Rapper]
I speak of promised lands
Soil as soft as momma's hands
Running water, standing still
Endless fields of daffodils and chamomile
Rice under black beans
Walked into Apple with cracked screens
And told prophetic stories of freedom
Found warmth in a Black queen for when I get cold
Like Nat King, I'm doing the dad thing
I speak of wondrous unfamiliar lessons from childhood
Make you remember how to smile good
I'm pre-currency, post-language, anti-label
Pro-famous, I'm Broadway Joe Namath
Kanye's best prodigy
He ain't signed me but he proud of me
I got some ideas that you gotta see
Make a vid with shawty and they ship it like the Odyssey
They never seen a rapper practice modesty
I never practice, I only perform
I don't even warn, I don't eat it warm, I won't be reborn
I speak to God in public, I speak to God in public
He keep my rhymes in couplets
He think the new shit jam, I think we mutual fans
I used to dance to Michael, I used to dance in high school
I used to pass out music, I still pass out music
The people's champ must be everything the people can't be
I'm getting artsy-fartsy, house full of some Hebru Brantleys
You must’ve missed the come up, I must be all I can be
Call me Mister Mufasa, I had to master stampedes

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
I made it through, made it through, made it through
And everything I gave to you, I gave to you, I gave to you
You got it, you got it, you got it, it's coming (Coming, coming, coming)
So are you ready?
Are you ready?

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign, BJ The Chicago Kid, Anderson .Paak, Raury, Nico Segal, Lolah Brown & Chance The Rapper (HaHa Davis)]
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Ten damn days
And all I got to show for it is shoes and shows
And chauffeurs with road rage
Still the same damn ad-lib: IGH!, old ways
Still got a letterman, no practice
Still got a burner, man, no lacking
Still outtin' Jams nigga, no Jackson
No Jordan and we toe-tagging
I'll take you to the land where the lake made of sand
And the milk don't pour and the honey don't dance
And the money ain't yours
Now it's just a red pill
Got a blue and a handful of Advils
I'm the new Nitty, fuck it, Nitty the old me
So I'mma tell the buyer what Nitty told me

[Chorus: Nate Fox]
I got that mmm, mmm, I got that God damn
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man
Pimp slappin', toe taggin', I'm just tryna fight the man
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man
I got that mmm, mmm, I got that God damn
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man
Pimp slappin', toe taggin', I'm just tryna fight the man
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
You a laaaaaaaame
And your bitch break down my weed sometimes
See my face in the streets, in the tweets
And a Reader or a RedEye if you read Sun-Times
She got blisters on her knees, she's a fiend for the D
Even though I only beat one time
One time, it was one two times
It was two plus me equals threesome time
Shouts out to Nate, I jackball and I bop, I flex
Got neck from all these thots I sex
Rastafari them shottas, yes
House safari, mi casa, yes
Poppy fields of that popeye
She came to party, she popped a Molly
Said, "Come to Papa", she said, "Papa, yes"

[Chorus: Nate Fox]
I got that mmm, mmm, I got that God damn
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man
Pimp slappin', toe taggin', I'm just tryna fight the man
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man
I got that mmm, mmm, I got that God damn
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man
Pimp slappin', toe taggin', I'm just tryna fight the man
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man

[Part II: Paranoia (produced by Nosaj Thing)]

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Move to the neighborhood; I bet they don't stay for good, watch
Somebody'll steal daddy's Rollie, call it the neighborhood watch
Pray for a safer hood when my paper good, watch
Captain Save-a-Hood, hood savior, baby boy
Still getting ID'd for Swishers (Mama still wash my clothes)
Still with the Save Money militia (I'mma still watch my bros)
Trapped in the middle of the map
With a little-bitty rock and a little bit of rap
That, with a literary knack
And a little shitty Mac, and like literally jack

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
They murking kids, they murder kids here
Why you think they don't talk about it? They deserted us here
Where the fuck is Matt Lauer at?
Somebody get Katie Couric in here
Probably scared of all the refugees
Look like we had a fuckin' hurricane here
They'll be shooting whether it's dark or not
I mean, the days is pretty dark a lot
Down here, it's easier to find a gun
Than it is to find a fucking parking spot
No love for the opposition, specifically a cop position
'Cause they've never been in our position
Getting violations from the nation, correlating, you dry snitchin'

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits

[Breakdown: Chance The Rapper]
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
I know you scared
Me too
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
If you was there
Then we'd just knew you cared too

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
It just got warm out, this the shit I've been warned 'bout
I hope that it storm in the mornin', I hope that it's pourin' out
I hate crowded beaches, I hate the sound of fireworks
And I ponder what's worse
Between knowing it's over and dyin' first
'Cause everybody dies in the summer
Wanna say your goodbyes, tell them while it's spring
I heard everybody's dying in the summer
So pray to God for a little more spring

[Breakdown: Chance The Rapper]
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
If you was there
Then we'd just knew you cared too[Intro]
Happy holidays Mr President

[Verse 1: Chance]
She can say in her voice, in her way that she love me
With her eyes, with her smile, with her belt, with her hands, with her money
I am the thesis of her prayers
Her nieces and her nephews are just pieces of the layers
Only ones she love as much as me is Jesus Christ and Taylor
I got a feature so I'm singing for my grandma
You singing too, but your grandma ain't my grandma
Mine's is handmade, pan fried, sun-dried
Southside, and beat the devil by a landslide
Praying with her hands tied, president of my fan club, saying to her
Something told me I should bring my butt to church

[Hook: Jamila Woods]
You gotta move slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for this whole week
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy
You gotta move it slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for this whole week
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy

[Bridge: Jamila Woods (Chance) [Choir]]
Come on in this house, it's gonna rain
(Mama you know!)
Rain down Zion
(Rain down)
It's gonna rain
(Mama you know!)
[You gotta move slowly]
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
(Mama you know!)
(Mama you know!)

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I come to church for the candy, your peppermints is the truth
I'm pessimistic on Monday if I had tweaked and missed you
You look so good with that hat on, had to match with the shoes
Came and dressed in the satin, I came and sat in your pew
I come to Christmas for dinner, fifty rolls on my plate
Hella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place
I like my love with a budget
I like my hugs with a scent
You smell like lights, gas, water, electricity, rent
You sound like why the gospel choir got so tired
Singin' his praises daily basis so I gotta try it
You're my dreamcatcher, dream team, team captain
Matter fact, I haven't seen you in a minute let me take my butt to church

[Bridge: Jamila Woods (Chance)]
You better come on in this house
(Come on in this house)
Cause it's gonna rain
(Mama you know it's gonna rain)
Rain down Zion
(Rain down)
It's gonna rain
(Mama you know it's gonna rain)
Come on down in this house
It's gonna rain
(Mama you know)
Rain down

[Interlude: Chance (Jamilla + Choir)]
Mama you know it's gon' rain
Father you know
(Rain down)
Promise you said it would rain
Finally I'm home
(Rain down)
You left on the light
When I left on a flight
But I made it alright
(Rain down)
I've been waiting all week
I've been waiting all night
(On me, rain down)
Baby, saving my life
Had to say something on Saturday
See you at church on Sunday
Open mic coming on Monday
I wonder what the Internet gon' say
When SNL end with the ending to the 3rd
Chance fly down the chimney
Me and Kiersten, Kensley, Lisa, Kenny, Taylor, Wendy all should win the Emmy
Momma should too!

[Bridge: Jamila Woods and Others]
Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
You better come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain[Produced by Apollo Brown]

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
This is six blunt rotation music
This is just got off six-month probation music
This is steppin' on the beach
When you're too drunk to feel a beat
This that laughing in a condo
Throwin' shit down in the street
This that shouts to the Ave, shouts to the lab
Shouts to the clucks, shouts to the strags
This for every math class that I ever had
So fuck you if I failed, and fuck you if I passed!
For shitty summaries and bummers in the past
Cause some of our teachers act as if summer was for class
Some of us is seeing summer, some of us have passed
Some of us ain't seeing summer, some of us have passed
So I'm just glad to say I'm sippin' rum up out a glass
Cause some of us is only sippin' some up off the grav'
And heaven's gates look a lot like prison from the Ave
We on the ground yelling, "Give my nigga back!"

[Chorus: Akenya Seymour]
And I just want to roll with my windows down
And I just want to roll with my windows down

[Verse 2: Alex Wiley]
Another weekend full of blunts and brews
Too comfortable, yelling "Fuck a school"
Ain't seen the world before noon in like a month or two
Blunts to the face, bottles to the dome
Niggas never need no cup
Livin' out dreams, never givin' hopes up
Ridin' with them Vill niggas, never givin' no fucks
In the game tryna get our feel, tryna get a deal
Tryna get a million
Just ridin' around with my niggas and them
Real white nigga man mean real appeal
We go all out 'til we fall out
Niggas get called out then hauled out
With the windows down we like to smoke all out
Drink 'til I fall out, fuck is you tahm bout boy
The Village is my brothers
It's me, Mikey, Kembe trappin'
Hella love for Chance The Rapper
We know 10 Day is a classic, on God

[Chorus: Akenya Seymour & Chance The Rapper]
And I just want to roll with my windows down
And I just want to roll with my windows down

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
This is for sand in my shoes, shout out to Oak Street
For the free train rides, shout out to Polk Street
To the ice cream man you just on hella dirt
How you don't see us can't hear us, you Helen Keller
But I'mma save my dollars for Mary Jane and embellish her
Inhalin' her, smellin' her, maybe sellin' her
You niggas got cold feet, shouts to Luke Helliker
But that's my homie, my dude be droppin' hella verses
So, shouts to D.O.C. and Nu Tribe too
Man we out this jam, see how new guys do
But its still save money like a coupon
So you can catch me off of the Ave gettin' my stoop on

[Chorus: Akenya Seymour & Chance The Rapper]
And I just want to roll with my windows down
And I just want to roll with my windows downYo, Andrew Barber! I just wanna say thank you to my team, for being here.... shit this is crazy... sorry uh, thank God for this, damn I'm shaking, this is crazy. Thank you everybody for supporting me. Thank you [?]. Oh... wooo! I love my family, I love God and I love music. Thank you, guys![Produced by Blended Babies]

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Turn the radio up and we can have a good time
Got me feeling like J.J. on Good Times
Back when Thelma had that ass, off the fam good
My sister said she likes my raps cause it sounds good
Told me not to cut corners, use to cut quarters
Sitting in the room, on the phone, cooking up orders
Till my pops popped me off, that was family matters
Used to watch him in the kitchen sipping Sammy Adams
Now I'm rollin', iPhone Stolen
Mama whip with 5 of my guys, 4 holdin'
Trying to live our lives like our lives are so golden
Got big shoes to fill like try go bowling
Til we strike out, we just hoping we don't strike out
4th quarter, how you gon go and take Mike out?
Summertime Chi, I had to pull the bike out
Riding getting nice cause it's nice out

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Let's land in the land where the Famo stay
Grind all day 'til the fam okay

For the fam of my friends when my mans go away
Let's land in the land where the Famo stay
Grind all day 'til the fam okay
It still warm my heart to hear my grandma pray
For the fam of my friends when my mans go away

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Don't wake up, don't wake up, don't wake up too fast
Don't make up your mind, you should flake on that class
Sing all you want, just don't Drake on they ass
Shore you got drive, don't turn fake on they ass
Good morning, good raps, good morrow, good luck
Tonight you could blow, tomorrow you suck
Bizarro, my carro, I borrowed from Chuck
A new SLR and Ferrarro deluxe
No money for the meter when I'm parkin' em
Gassed than a bitch no car with him
Market him, tell him that he's buzzing like a game of operation with Parkinsons
Young kid rappers, kidnappers
Young whipper snapper that will whip past ya
Will get at you, come get at you
Wanna break ya off, ome Kit-Kat you

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Let's land in the land where the Famo stay

[Verse 3: Sulaiman]
Now the team work make the dream work
Go ahead and send an application if you need work
If it need hurt, then I'mma bring hurt
How you finna see the clouds if you never seen dirt
Now you finna play it loud, listen how it's goin down
Didn't know the name before bet you niggas know it now
Chi-City niggy, made a 50 out a penny
Got some titties at the cribby and the Savemoney with me and we going in
Going all out for them hoes again
Now I'm fin to bring the fucking flow and bend it back
And show it's more to this than rap
Love my parents for supporting cause they know I'm finna crack
Know my niggas got my back, got some niggas selling packs
But I'm tryin' to get em cheese so I can get em out the trap
Now my figures getting fat, a lot of hoes be tryin' to jack
But I got her on my lap, all she do is make it clap

Niggas try to come at me and shit like
On some like, I only write slow songs
And I only write...church and
How many of y'all are fucking with me with a pen, period?

[Verse]
I'm a writer, probably as good as Elton John
But what's writing good for if it ain't helping moms?
I'm tryna feed Japan while seeing sights of Lebanon
And wiping away tears of girls that's getting felted on
I'm tryna get my felt pen on, but the block is hot
My hands is questioning if I'm Bach or not
If I'm 2Pac or nonexistent to these juggernauts
But I'm a architect an astronaut an argonaut
So hey, you, get off my couch
You don't know me? Stay the fuck out my mouth
But I'm a writer you can quote it out loud
A false poet get my dough and I'm out
But here's an eighth of shrooms for your earlobe
A little rap wrapped in cigarillo
A little bit of Wu-Tang, mixed with some Henry David Thoreau
A little ponder theory you can ponder on your pillow
But this is for the day that your dad dies
But for some reason all you hearing is sad sighs
You searchin' for nostalgia but sad and you can't cry
So you check your iPod in search for some bad vibes
From that rap guy, who raps over sad vibes
I wrote it in an hour dawg, don't know what your dad's like
He probably was a great dad, he's probably in paradise
You want deeply in heartbreak and sadly I can't write nothing
This is for those who wrote suicide notes
And all the hipster girls that was super fly dope
You looking at her nose what you do besides coke
You looking at her palms what you do besides dope
Nothing, life is but a supersized note
I open up my mind like suicide door
And grab a pimp cane and a superfly coat
Have they bobbing they heads to something stupid I wrote
I hope[Produced by Peter Cottontale]

[Verse 1]
Here’s a tab of acid for your ear
You’re the plastic, I’m the passion and the magic in the air
The flabbergasted avalanche of ambulances near
The labyrinth of Pan’s Lab is adamantly here
No assignments, book of rhyming and I’m drawing doodles
I should rhyme rhyme with Ramen Noodles
Ramadan, I’m the Don of the diamond jewels
Fond of finding a way to kindly tell these toddlers toodles
I’m a kamikaze and I’m a kinda cuckoo
I could write a fucking book, non-kamasutral
You niggas goofies, it's a conflict that is kinda crucial
Caught you on the 9 in all blue yelling I’m a neutral
But I’ma let the bull pass like matadors
Versus a Minotaur, verse is a metaphor
Metamorphoses and I’ma fuckin animorph
I used to go to school with Anna Fedele & Danny Whorf
Remember I used to bang with the bad ones
'Til my grandmama told on her grandson
Mama said that I was way too handsome
To be throwing the hand’s son, breaking walls like Samson
But I’ma throw a tantrum 'til I’m on every Samsung
Sanyo and handheld and handgun
Please put ya lighter’s up 'til life is up and light it up
And slice a cut, the night is young, it’s nice enough
The nicest blunt, the nicest stuff
My niggas out here trapping a lot
I know you think you on, hiding Reggie sacks in your socks
I hang with niggas, whole jab in the jock
.4’s for 15, yeah my nigga, we be taxing a lot
Only the goofies though, choking on a doobie though
My eyes do be low, two be rolled, remember days of the Rufio
Remember the Days of Chan-Man and the Skeeter Man
Brrang dang to Lil' B and bang a-rang to Peter Pan
IGH! Nigga
I burned, I, I bu-, I bu-, I burned
I burned, I, I, I burned
Br-br-br, hahahah

[Chorus]
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, nigga
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, now now now
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, IGH!
I burned too many brain cells down
Down down down down down

[Verse 2]
Light a joint, or spliff it if you classy
Split a swisha witcha nigga if you ask me
Ain’t no questions hit it vividly and pass me
Don’t answer about your problems
Or your issues or your Ashleys
It’s a quarter to imminent, ten minutes to infinite
Rims, Henny, and reminisce, nostalgia and M&M's
Cinnamon tone women and feminine’s getting intimate
All broads is frivolous, homies could get they dividends
Is he illiterate, literal syndicate
Illegitimate, idiot, gangbanger affiliate
Sick twisted prick, sick sadistic
Son of a biscuit, man fuck this shit
IGH! I burned too many brain cells down
I burned, I burned, hahah
I burned too many brain cells down
Burned too many brain cells down, sing it with me

[Chorus]
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
Burned too many brain cells down, no no
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, nigga
I burned too many brain cells down
Burned too many brain cells down
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, oh no
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, fuck 'em
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
I burned too many brain cells down[Refrain]
Heads bowed for the curly haired sons of Abraham
Dear Father, guide all my brothers away from Sam
If they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam
If they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam
Shake that jam
Heads bowed for the curly haired sons of Abraham
Dear Father, guide all my brothers away from Sam
If they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam
If they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam

[Verse 1]
Chance The Rapper, song singer, senior, bong steamer
Light up hot wheels, locked up, wrong steamer
Dreamer, long Beemers, our neighbors their, lawns greener
We wrestle with envy then act up, John Cena
Chancellor Bennett, referred to as word chemist
The bourbon and slurred sentences is turning up burning bridges
Cigarette stained smile, all covered in sin
My big homie died young, just turned older than him
Getting hyped up off them bad bitches on it
Getting knocked up off a nigga, bad luck
Getting scared now with them IRS audits
All the tax money that I didn’t add up
That I didn’t get yet, but they think that I got it
Keep a long shirt so they think that I got it
And if they all dummy and a nigga get bodied
It was really, really ill, I know a nigga held up
Hell yeah I’ll always get a pic with y’all niggas
Word to my fans, all six of y'all niggas
I seen all the tweets and the tips from y’all niggas
Got hands for them niggas that pick on y'all niggas
Loving your love, an album to come
I bet that you love it, comes out in a month
Chance, the astounding class clown
That turned out to amount into something, 3001

[Hook]
I count my blessings too often
My best friends on one hand
My sheep when I’m done here
Gotta get up, get up
I count my blessings too often
My best friends on one hand
My sheep when I’m done here
Gotta get up, get up

[Verse 2]
Knock knock said the fist to the world
Shine sun through the mist and debris
Bang bang said the fist to the young
Silence from the lips of the free
Say something important, say something important
Make money the end of the week
But that shit coming soon, I’m getting hungry
Might sell out in a couple of weeks
But my crib they buckin’
And they just called Buddy, that’s lil bro
Even though last time we spoke
We was arguing, but we still stay close
Ask God to watch the squad
On God, battle niggas to the death, alright
Fuck your squad and the whole facade
I ain’t never scared of where a nigga reside
Extra mild sauce on the side, extra mileage on the ride
Express, I'mma grab my chain
Cause it’s extra violence all on the nine
Ten days, that’s an awful lot
Eleven squares in like fifteen minutes
Sixteens when that album comes
Spit twelve real quick for a listening picnic, igh!

[Hook]
I count my blessings too often
My best friends on one hand
My sheep when I’m done here
Gotta get up, get up
I count my blessings too often
My best friends on one hand
My sheep when I’m done here
Gotta get up, get up

[Refrain]

If they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam
Shake that jamI still have keys that are of no use to me,
They used to though.
On the other side was a mansion on a hill,
Complete with LA pools and fireplaces,
And a rim made specifically for people who lie about being six feet to dunk on,
Where a piano was for decoration and an old record player was actually for the hoes,
I was never awakened by the twisting of a door knob,
Benzo’s kissed me goodnight,
The bars finally stopped working,
They used to though.
On the other side was a presidential suite,
Complete with living rooms and empty beds and a rainfall showered fixture and the freedom to smoke big dope,
And smoking fees also,
And the possibility of making a beautiful girl I just met, map out in her mind just how many times her apartment could fit in this room,
If I could just get in.
The card stopped working,
They used to though.
On the other side was a family,
Complete with carpet stains and big loves and “its your turn’s" and toys all over the place
(I almost fell and broke my fucking neck),
And responsibility and refrigerator magnets,
And days on the couch and nights on the couch,
And lines drawn in the sand and comebacks that cross the line,
And a horn line from my favourite make-up song plays,
And just like that, we've rehabbed a home,
DeBarge stopped working.
I still have all the keys that are of no use to me
They used to work though.Cover Art:

Chance the Rapper - "JUICE"


Chance the Rapper LogoUh, I didn't think that... I didn't think that we were gonna get this one so I don't have cool stuff to say this time... I just... once again I wanna thank God for everything that he's accomplished for me, everything that he's went through with me. I wanna thank him for my father, for my mother, for my brother, Taylor Bennett. For my friends like Justin Cunningham and [?] and Darius White. And this is for every indie artist, everybody who's been doing this mixtape shh stuff for a long ass time. Shouts out to DJ Drama for doing it first! He put in that time. Shouts out to every independent artist out there. Shouts out to SoundCloud for holding me down. It's another record, baby![Chorus: Peter Cottontale]
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay

[Verse 1]
I could spare a rib to get my baby back
I just wanna fall asleep where my baby at
So I don't wake up wondering where my baby at
I wonder if we'll make it back
I wonder "Can I pay her back, please"
65th and Ingleside
Way before Jamie got his jingles right
I was sleeping with you every single night
But I was still tryna act single right
65th and Ingleside
I was stacking chips like bingo night
I didn't have to pay for a single light
So I'ma make sure everything go right

[Chorus: Peter Cottontale]
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay

[Verse 2]
Your sister owned the house we lived in
On the East Side that you rented
Little two flat, inexpensive
I didn't have a glove to pitch in
I didn't have a pot to piss in
Not to mention in Dro City
Not a lot of jobs with pensions
All my raps was 'bout suspension
Then one day Donald took me on tour
Young broke Chano ain't broke no more
Thought you wouldn't want me come and darken your doorstep
But I still haven't given you what's yours yet
65th and Ingleside
Moved downtown for a single life
None of my stars ever twinkled bright
'Til God decide to come bring you by

[Chorus: Peter Cottontale]
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay

[Verse 3]
Where's the return on investment? My first A&R
That shit was played unless you would hit play in the car
We hit the Shell station, I tell you stay in the car
Back in the spot, don't put it in park
Leave that bitch running in case I come running
And skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, grab the gold SCAR
There it get late 'fore it's dark
Kensli couldn't play in the park
Now she could play in the stars
High rise, eye to eye with fireworks
So high your ears fire, they might've burst
Every time they buy a verse, I buy a purse
But you can't buy back time, that's just not how it works
Three jobs, you afforded the crib
Fuck child support, you supported the kid
A full rack a month, nothing short of my rib
So you first up, go in order of dibs
My big homie told me, "Nigga growth and development
Go and settle down, don't settle for settlement"
She got you closer to God than you two ever been
She moved over from Evanston, you moved over from Eggleston
First lady you knew, you can't marry her?
Got shit sonny, now you can't share?
New Dad step in, you can’t stare?
You knew the power in the woman that could lead you in prayer
On 65th and Ingleside
Feel like you remember every single lie
Truth is I just really need your finger size
So I can make sure that they make the ring so tight

[Chorus: Peter Cottontale]
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay[Verse: Chance The Rapper]
We want some heroes in our story
We need highlights for a nightlight, we need glory for a while
We want results, we want results
Hit our families, hit our folks
Bombs bursting in air
Oh say
Can you see America's face?
We share a pair of parents, took good care of the place
We just want narrators to pick up the narrative's pace
Put on a show for us, float for us
Make it easy, make some more for us
Save the date
We want a W, we tired of picking different sides
I got your jersey, just a different size
We all want you to be a buzzer beater
Find us a leader far from Silent Bobs and Cousin Skeeters
Through the perilous fight, want you to be brave
You want to see a hero? You need a teammate

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
People, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go
We're right by your side
People, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go
We're right by your side

[Bridge: Jack Red]
And now that we made it
Came in with an angel around us
Put it all in what we doing next
Ooo you know we can't go without it
Never go alone it never lasts
So we get to make what we want
Home has come at last
Yeaaa

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
People, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go
We're right by your side
People, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go
We're right by your side
People, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go
We're right by your side
People, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go
We're right by your side[Produced by Beirut]

[Intro]
Well it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smile

[Verse 1]
I wonder if Gladys smiles when angels bring my name up
Or change language and subject change up
Her boy’s a long way from red dogs and green rangers
Things ain’t been the same since Ms. Patterson called me famous
I saw your reflection in a toilet full of vomit water
You don’t think I felt ya hand on my head yelling “Call his father”
But people don’t hear ghosts so how they gon' play me
Money saved me so I’ma do the same thing
You droppin' pounds, gettin' small on some sick shit
Like how you got the drive but don’t know how to use a stick shift
You better not miss this, overdose, dope and mixes
Let ya throat close with a boatload of dope quotes within it
Blast off...

[Verse 2]
Dropping tapes 'til I losted count, coughing out blood
Dropping weight like I lost an ounce
Throwing words and tossing nouns
NY traveling I’m Boston bound, bossing 'round homies
And talking down to shorties while I’m jotting down
Notes to spit to Harlem crowns
Surfing through the Harlem crowds
At the crib, I’m falling down
Yeah, I'm steady crawling 'round
I’m calling out to God
Your little angels falling down
Save me from my darkened cloud
Reach your hands and arms around

[Bridge]
Oh non je t'en prie, nous ne sommes pas chez nous
Oh je t'assure que ce n'est pas grave
Non laisse moi!
Mais qu'est-ce que tu as aujourd'hui?
J'ai que les hommes me dégoûtent. Vous ne pensez qu'à ça

[Chorus]
Well it’s been a long time, long time now
Since I’ve seen you smile
And I’ll gamble away my fright
And I’ll gamble away my time
And in a year, a year or so
This will slip into the sea
Well it’s been a long time, long time now
(Oh it’s, oh it’s been so long)
Since I’ve seen you smile
(It’s been so long)

[Outro]
Said it’s been a long time, long time now, now, now
Said it’s been a long time, long time now
And it’s been a long time, long time now[Intro]
Yeah
Oh, yeah y'all gon' let [?]
Swear y'all gon' [?]
Sing it, uh

[Chorus]
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, oh no
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, oh no
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
Down, down, down-down, uh

[Verse 1]
Uh, here’s a tab of acid for your ear
You’re the plastic, I’m the passion and the magic in the air
The flabbergasted avalanche of ambulances near
The labyrinth of Pan’s Lab is adamantly here
No assignments, book of rhyming and I’m drawing doodles
I should rhyme rhyme with Ramen Noodles
Ramadan, I’m the don of the diamond jewels
Fond of finding a way to kindly tell these toddlers toodles
I’m a kamikaze and I’m kinda cuckoo
I could write a fucking book, non-Kamasutral
You niggas goofies, it's a conflict that is kinda crucial
Caught you on the 9 in all blue yelling, "I’m a neutral"
But I’ma let the bull pass like matadors
Versus a Minotaur, verse is a metaphor
Metamorphoses and I’m a fuckin animorph
I used to go to school with Anna Fedele and Danny Whorf
Remember I used to bang with the bad ones
'Til my grandmama told on her grandson
Mama said that I was way too handsome
To be throwing the hand’s son, breaking walls like Samson
But I’ma throw a tantrum 'til I’m on every Samsung
Sanyo and handheld and handgun
Please put ya lighter’s up 'til life is up, then light it up
And slice a cut, the night is young, it’s nice enough
The nicest blunt, the nicest stuff
My niggas out here trapping a lot
I know you think you on, hiding Reggie sacks in your socks
I hang with niggas, whole jab in the jock
.4’s for 15, yeah my niggas, we be taxing a lot
Only the goofies, though, choking on a doobie, though
My eyes do be low, two be rolled, remember days of the Rufio
Remember the Days of Chan-Man and the Skeeter Man
Brrang dang to Lil' B and bang a-rang to Peter Pan

[Chorus]
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, oh no
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, oh no
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
Down, down, down-down, uh

[Verse 2]
Light a joint, or spliff it if you classy
Split a swisha witcha nigga if you ask me
Ain't no questions, hit it vividly and pass me
Don’t answer about your problems
Or your issues or your athletes
It’s a quarter to imminent, ten minutes to infinite
Rims, Henny, and reminisce, nostalgia and M&M's
Cinnamon tone women and feminine’s getting intimate
All broads is frivolous and homies could get they dividends
Damn, is he illiterate, literal syndicate
Illegitimate, idiot, gangbanger-affiliate
Sick twisted prick, dick sadistic
Son of a biscuit, man fuck this shit, uh

[Chorus]
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, oh no
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
Down, down, down-down

[Outro]
Oh no, no, no
Oh no, no
Oh no, no, no, no
And this is my 10 Day
This is my 10 Day, oh no
Welcome 10 Day

Remix!

[Verse]
I got the baddest chick on the planet
She ain't mixed but folks be askin' if she half Hispanic
She complain about the baby weight but I ain't panicked
Since she got pregnant she been showin' crack like bad mechanics
I rub her feet, I put in work like I was Robyn Fenty
The only chick that I hold as much is probably Kinsley
I sit with her and watch Black Ink and Being Mary
But never Love & Hip Hop, that shit get kinda scary
She stand about six feet, she used to hoop at 'Lane
I tried to stick her the other day and got my ankle sprained
I fell deep, tried to leave, but you know the way that you learn best
Is leavin' out the garage and get hit with that U-turn text
So if you got a girl and she sexy and she grown
Stay your ass at home 'fore you end up all alone
Leave the toilet seat down, always keep your phone
Ask my BM, she got her own ringtone, and she was singing...Tell us in the comment section at the bottom of the page which show and/or festival you will be attending and if you found any information helpful or something we might have missed!

Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fu-fuck you
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fu-fuck you
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fu-fuck you (Yep)

Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fu-fuck you (No)
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you

[Verse 1]
I ain't no activist, I'm the protagonist
I don't co-captain it, I fly solo like one cup in the cabinet
The cab is the cabinet, they trust me at landing it
They call me the advocate, they'll slide like the abacus
Boy meets world, everybody been savages
I just want to really know how much that your shooter averages
I'm not no nice guy, I'm just the good guy
The bad guys should really stay on my good side
I smelled my roses younger than the good die
The Illuminati couldn't see me with they good eye
They think they Heath Ledger scary, they just Jack Nichols
I'm a sign to my city like the Bat-Signal
Young chosen one, golden boy, De La Hoya
It ain't too many me's, rest in peace to Verne Troyer
I was younger than I seemed as a kid
I mean my G17 18 in the head
I mean I'm only 25 but I'm Motown 25
Bet I get a statue in my hometown when I die
And Rahm, you done, I'm expectin' resignation
An open investigation on all of these paid vacations for murderers

[Interlude]
Fuck you, oh-oh
Fuck you, fuck you
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fuck you-ou-ou-ou
Fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu, fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu

Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fu-fuck you
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, oh

[Verse 2]
I don't get no paper, I gotta sign at the bottom
Still in my bag like the fries at the bottom
And I can't do nothing right, they gon' always be at me
I missed a Crain's interview, they tried leaking my addy
I donate to the schools next, they call me a deadbeat daddy
The Sun-Times gettin' that Rauner business
I got a hit-list so long I don't know how to finish
I bought the Chicagoist just to run you racist bitches out of business
Speaking of racist, fuck your microaggressions
I'll make you fix your words like a typo suggestion
Pat me on the back too hard and Pat'll ask for your job
And in unrelated news, someone'll beat your ass at your job
I'm the real deal
Who taught all these rappers that a big deal's not a big deal?
Inherited the earth, popping wheelies on a big wheel
My enemy lives in his mother's basement
That's why my videos don't got no Baphomet product placement
I'm a real one
The honey is sweet, the apple's bitter
They'll try to convince you you stronger without your woman than when you with her
And tell you they kidding while Twitter trashing your litter
I know the devil's a liar
I know that players is quitters, I heard you hire your hitters
I know the higher the bidder, that mean the less on return
So I just hire a sitter
I'm not no boss nigga, I'm a soldier
Kingdom builder, man somebody shoulda told ya
Fuck you

[Outro: Jamie Foxx]
Fuck you, oh-oh
Fuck you, fuck you
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fuck you-ou-ou-ou
Fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu, fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu
Fuck you, oh-oh
Fuck you, fuck you
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fuck you-ou-ou-ou
Fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu, fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu
Fuck you, fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fu-fuck you
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fu-fuck you
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fu-fuck you
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fu-fuck you[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
They say keep going
He said he came from Hawaii
Then everybody done tried me, I can't go by me
(I've never heard anybody rhyme with Hawaii before)
I bypass, look I buy paths
(I bypass on a fat ass) (no, no, no look)
I bypass, I've been wrecking mics
I bypass, I've been, I've been wrecking mics since Dreamcast

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Dreamcast, I dream fast
That's a disconap, I got a disco gap
This is a real small one
I'm a tall one
I don't follow 'em, but I might fall 'em
In the fall but
You don't wanna fall boy
You don't wanna tall boy
You sippin' on them little cans

[Verse 3: Riff Raff]
Legendary hemwork, check my hot tub pants
The way I stance, I got Jody Husky sing you into a trance
Two of us cost 750 plus a ticket
One point seven, I shoulda got a Prevost
We ball the most
Who gone ball from coast to coast
Who gone sip the playa potion
Who would ride tour bus three motion
I three wheeled a tour bus
I came through just the ten of us, Bentley Bus
Who done did that?
I used to drive a Honda, now I got a Benz back[Intro: Francis & The Lights]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, incredible
My lord... incredible
I believe...

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Socks on concrete, Jolly Rancher kids
I was talkin' back and now I gotta stay at grandma's crib
Bunch of tank-top, nappy headed bike-stealin' Chatham boys
None of my niggas ain't had no dad
None of my niggas ain't have no choice
JJ, Mikey, Lil Derek and them
79th street was America then
Ice cream truck and the beauty supply
Blockbuster movies and Harold's again
We were still catchin' lightnin' bugs
When the plague hit the backyard
Had to come in at dark cause the big shortys act hard
Okay now, day camp at Grand Crossing
First day, nigga's shootin'
Summer school get to losin' students
But the CPD getting new recruitment
Our summer don't, our summer
Our summer don't get no shine no more
Our summer die, our summertime don't got no time no more

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper + Francis & The Lights]
'Cause you're my friend
Summer friends don't stay
You're my friend
Summer friends don't stay, stay around
Summer friends, summer friends
You're my friend
Summer friends don't stay
Summer friends don't stay, hey
Stay around here

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Oh I used to kill 'em with the long hair
Mama hair salon doin' perms out the armchair
Dad was workin' late, he treat the crib like it's a timeshare
I would mow some lawns
Fold my ones like a lawn chair, hugh, hugh!
Now I'm the same way, overtime all the time, every night, hey
Ready my blessin', now I'm ready how I wait
Never let a friendship get in my way
Never let a blog get in my way
Make the whole song do whatever I say
79th, 79th, 79th, hey
79th, 79th, 79th, hey
Some of my homegirls got lost in the paperwork
They was good friends but I faked the flirt
'Cause if it ain't work, can't make it work
It's been a minute since I called on a friend
Fucked up and fucked all my friends

[Pre-Chorus: Chance The Rapper & Francis & The Lights]
'Cause you're my friend
All my friends
You're my friend
All my...
Stick around

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & Francis & The Lights]
Summer friends, summer...
You're my friend...
Summer friends don't stick around
Stick around, hey
And some of us...
79th, 79th, 79th, hey
79th, 79th, 79th, hey
79th, 79th, 79th, hey, hey, hey
You're my friend
79th, 79th, 79th, hey, 79th
So put your head on my shoulder
Citywide, citywide, citywide, hey
Citywide, citywide, citywide, hey
Citywide, citywide, citywide, hey

May the Lord give your journey mercy
May you be successful, grant you favor
And bring you back safely, I love you

[Outro: Jeremih]
When I was so young before I could remember
I would always treat my gang like family members
Even when I changed, a nigga never changed up
I always bring my friends, my friends, my friends, my friends up
When I was so young before I could remember
I would always treat my gang like family members
Even when I changed, a nigga never changed up
I always bring my friends, my friends, my friends, my friends up[Chorus 1]
We don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
'Cause she don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

[Verse 1]
When did you change?
Wendy, you've aged
I thought you'd never grow up
I thought you'd never
Window closed, Wendy got old
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was

[Chorus 2]
'Cause we don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
She don't laugh the same way no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

[Verse 2]
Where did you go?
Why would you stay?
You must have lost your marbles
You always were so forgetful
In a hurry, don't wait up
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was
'Cause we don't, we don't do what we say we're gonna
You were always perfect, and I was only practice
Don't you miss the days, stranger?
Don't you miss the days?
Don't you miss the danger?

[Chorus 3: Chance The Rapper + (Eryn Allen Kane)]
We don't (we don't) do the same drugs no more (do the same drugs no more)
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't (we don't) do the same drugs no more (do the same drugs no more)
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs

[Outro: Chance The Rapper + (Eryn Allen Kane)]
(Turn it around
I remember when
This age of pathetics)
Don't forget the happy thoughts
All you need is happy thoughts
The past tense, past bed time
Way back then when everything we read was real
And everything we said rhymed
Wide eyed kids being kids
Why did you stop?
What did you do to your hair?
Where did you go to end up right back here?
When did you start to forget how to fly?
(It's so natural
Just like Juicy Fruit
Works like a magic trick
Please give me half of that
We don't, we don't, we don't)
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line
Dandelion
(Do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't, we don't, we don't....)

Yep, igh! igh! igh!

I got suspended, ooohh you got suspended
For chiefin' a hunnid blunts, 14,400 minutes
Fans all in the stands, they hands for Mr. Bennett
That racket over the net, ooohh give me my tennis
Shoes, give me a minute, ooohh I can't be tardy
My class is already started, they told my mom I'm retarded
But that 10Day done in one night, Honda from a Hyundai
No tassel in the spring, but after summer I'm alumni
They took my nigga one night, and I was standing right there
An inch away from Heaven, a million songs from right here
A step away from South by, a swing away from Cali
A hook away from verses, I'm a dad away from rapping
So at the school they arrested him
Back seat, squad car, nestled in
Shouts to the bitch nigga Heselton
Wit' his Big Show body ass wrestlin'
Finna see the 10Day Pestilence
So far, so good, so special and
No stars, good jobs, or excellents
And I'm still so fucking nonchalant
Ooohh you got suspended, ooohh you not gon' finish
Ooohh you look familiar, ooohh you look like Kenneth
Damn they gon' resent it, ooohh you representin'
A class of bad kids, 14,400 minutes, ahhh!

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Sparring is training, chain-snatching the slaves
But a rap song is a match in a cave
Dim lit, wet wick, wicked wrath in its way
Drunk off of light, lies, laughing
Claiming asylum while shying in shade
I can't stay silent, I go violent when my violets is gray
And my roses is black
Fuck the pharaohs and the Pharisees, Moses is back
I don't need to see a Sphinx to know they noses was black
I don't know one Temptation that had Otis's back
Sparring is training; this a jumping jack
I'm the scariest Jack in the pumpkin patch
Float like my jumper wet, sting like a bumblebee
I swing like a lumberjack, go back when I'm up at bat
They tried to label me a non-rapper
I'm an independent contractor, card cracker
Sparring is training without the training wheels
You made it, you made it, you made it, yeah, you made a deal
You played it straight, hated, graduated
Waited-waited, you still a waiter still
Mice will always find out ways to steal
Picture me, fifth of Hennessy and a Swisher Sweet
Fake identity, 'til a plug named Trinity shook me
"Wake up, wake up," like "Remember me?"
Said one plus one make three, and you finna see
You ain't as grown as you finna be
You got them young nigga tendencies

[Verse 2: Noname]
Mm... Sentimental energy
I let the light in beside him, I stand like angel
Sparring is training for an apathetic halo
Apologetic, nonreligious, consequential fable
Like good is good, the love in me is goodly, or godly
The Bible say mistakes is necessary
So I Mississippi monologue to granny house
My soloist is sold out to attentive God
Cornbread on my table when I say my prayers
On airs, to stairs where shadiness is time to rest or manifest
Sparring is training, I know they think me bumblebee
Afro-Americano Sunny D, but bet I sting, no die

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper & Both]
Sparring is training, Jacob wrestled with God
In the desert 'til he broke him and he blessed him
And he rescued his heart
I struggle with love, I juggle my loves
I cuddle and coddle, ship wreckin' bottle, I huddle in hugs
Sparring is training bra, Ramses watching raining frogs
Jigga watching Damon, Damon watching Wayans Bros
A tandem unicycle with two pilots in different maps

[Transition: Noname (Chance The Rapper)]
You giving back? (I'm giving back)
Tit for tat

[Verse 4: Noname]
Synagogue and bottle caps
A body in the underpass says, where's my Jesus?
Pledge allegiance to the money now
We runnin down to kiddie parks where darker kids be casualty
Like come with me, to the museum

[Transition: Noname & Chance The Rapper]
Excuse them, they know of what they do

[Verse 5: Chance The Rapper]
Sparring is training, don't let Denzel Training Day you
Sensei could catch a fade too
We be on that elegant, hella melanin
Pelle Pelles since they crayons and jelly pens

[Outro: Chance The Rapper & Noname]
And now you know Noname ain't never for none
Ayo, you know Chano ain't never for none
And now you know Noname ain't never for none
Ayo, you know Chano ain't never for none
Ha-HA!! And you don't stop
Ayy! Ayy!
Boom bap, and you don't stop

Nah that was... Oh shit![Produced by Cam]

Ken: Well I should have you hooked up next week

Chance: It's all good or whatever, I can wait 'til my birthday. I uh-

Ken: No, no, no, no. I told ya, I know you need it now, so next week I promise you I'll have you hooked up, ok?

Chance: Oh, alright. I just wanted to say thank you for everything. For the computer, the T-Shirts, and all the other stuff

Ken: You know, Chance. Let me tell you something. You know, I could never be more proud of anything in my life, you know, than I am of you and what you've done. Chance, you have done remarkable and wondrous things, so you don't have to tell me thank you for anything. I'm supposed to do this, that stuff for you anyway, and ya know, just keep doing what you're doing. I am very, very proud of you. Just keep doing what you're doing, ok?

Chance: Thank you, love you

Ken: Alright, son. Love you too, take care

Chance: Bye bye

Thanks for coming guys

[Verse]
'Member sittin' in class the first time listening to Dilla
Everything's good
Rubbin' on yo chin, sippin gin, Margiela brand chinchilla
Everything's good
My manager backpack packed with packs of cigarillos
And some fruit snacks, and some killers
Phone numbers on speed dial call them save monkey guerillas
Everything's good
I ain't really that good at goodbyes
I ain't really that bad at leaving
I ain't really always been a good guy, I used to be thirsty thievin'
Runnin through purses, even persons leave 'em hurtin' bleedin'
I ain't really help the helpless
I used to be worse than worthless
Now I'm worth hooks and verses
I'm good like books in churches
Harolds and Hooks and Churches
Everything's Good
See my name when you Google search it
Use a card when I make a purchase
Everything's Good
But I knew I was fly when I was just a caterpillar
That I'd make it even if I never make a milla
When I meet my maker he gon' make sure that we chillin'
And everything's good
I ain't really that good at goodnight, I ain't really that bad at sleepin'
With bad bitches, put them aside, I used to be thirsty creeping
Now I'm out working evenings, birthdays, even Tuesdays
Wednesdays, Thursdays, weekends, rehearsing verses, murdering merch and events
Damn it feel good to be a gangsta
And it feel good for me to thank you
Put money back in your bank account
Off of songs I barely could think up
'Cause a lot of songs niggas gon' make up
Make sense, but they never gon' make a sound
And I'm better than I was the last time, crescendo
Thanks Justin, lending them pencils
Mr. Menzies, Mensa, Chris Minto
The time I beat Chris on Nintendo
Nanana hey hey, good intro
Remember jacket shoppin' after listening to Thriller
Remember the first time you heard this through and thought, "damn that's that nigga."
Everything's good

The first is that God is better than the world's best thing
God is better than the best thing that the world has to offer

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Magnify, magnify, lift it on high
Spit a Spotify to qualify a spot on His side
I cannot modify or ratify, my momma made me apple pies
Lullabies and alibis, the book don't end with Malachi
Devil will win employee of the month by the dozen
'Til one score and three years from the third when he doesn't
My village raised 'em a child, come through the crib and it's bustin'
You meet anyone from my city, they gon' say that we cousins
Shabach barak, edify
Electrify the enemy like Hedwig till he petrifies
Any petty Peter Petigrew could get the pesticide, 79th, 79th
I don't believe in science, I believe in signs
Don't believe in signing, I seen dollar signs, color white collar crime
Good God, the gift of freedom, Hosanna Santa invoked
And woke up slaves from Southampton to Chatham Manor
My dream girl's behind me, feel like I'm James Early
The type of worship make Jesus come back a day early
With the faith of a pumpkin-seed-sized mustard seed
Hear, for I will speak noble things as entrusted me
Only righteous, I might just shrug at the skullduggery
I couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody
Exalt, exalt, glorify, descend upon the earth with swords
And fortify the borders where your shortage lie
I used to hide from God, ducked down in the slums like "shhh"

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
I was lost in the jungle like Simba after the death of Mufasa
No hog, no meerkat
Hakuna matata by day
But I spent my night time fighting tears back
I prayed and prayed and left messages
But never got no hear back, or so it seemed
A mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream
I build the ark to gently, gently
Row my boat down Noah's stream
Sometimes the path I took to reach
My petty goals was so extreme
I was so far down in the mud
Couldn't even let my light shine
But you was always there
When I needed to phone a friend or use a life line
From a lofty height we wage war
On the poltergeist with the exalted Christ
Spark the dark with the pulse of light
Strike a corpse with a pulse of life
I spit on the Tidal, it's tidal waves
I spit on the Apple and kill a worm
A fire in Cali will swallow a valley
For every African village burned
Jay Elect would've never made it
O' son of man, O' son of man
Who was the angel in Revelations
With a foot on water and a foot on land?
Who was the angel that rode a Harley
From the project to the house of Parliament
And opened the book in the Devil's chamber
And put the true name of the Lord in it?
Old Jerusalem, New Jerusalem
Comes like this beast with a ball of fire
They poisoned the scriptures
And gave us the pictures of false messiahs, it was all a lie
Mystery babylon, tumbling down
Satan's establishment crumbling down
This is the year that I come for the crown
Bury my enemies under the ground[Produced by Chuck Inglish]

Get knocked up off a nigga bad luck
Gettin scared now

We used to roll at the Rink, we used to roll at the Rink
I used to talk way too much, you used to know everything
You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you
You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too
Your big brother foot work
Your play sister Juke
The Rink was the place
But in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me, too worried 'bout Frooties and Chews
'Til I found out all the shawdy's with cooties was cute
And realized what booties could do

We gon' get it poppin'
We gon' get it Jukin'
We gon' throw a party
We ain't gotta do shit

Came up with for the weekend
Rolling with your parties
So tell me what you thinkin'
So we gon' have a juke jam
So we gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do
I'll get close to you
I remember you
You used to "I remember you"

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
We've got so much history baby, maybe
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe I'm crazy

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
We never rolled at the Rink
We would just go to the Rink
You ain't buy tokens no more
You just hip roll at the Rink
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him
But when they play "Take You Down", Chris Brown
I am his stand-in
I mean it's just dancing
It's harmless as fuck
Then I put my waist through your hips
And your legs and my arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor
All the kiddies stop skating
To see grown folks do, what grown folks do
When they grown and they dating

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
We've got so much history baby, maybe
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe I'm crazy
Crazy about you

So we gon' have a juke jam
So we gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do
I'll get close to you
I remember you
You used to "I remember you"

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
We've got so much history baby (juke)
Maybe (juke)Does it feel like an eternity since Acid Rap?
It feels way shorter. Every day is a workday. It's hard to explain. When you're working on shit every day and it comes back full circle three months later, it doesn't hit you the same way. Cause it's something I knew I was working on.

Can you gauge your increasing fame?
Definitely. I do recognize it all the time. But it's not like . . . I don't necessarily feed into the whole newfound-fame type shit, or feeling like a different person. If anything, it makes me realize how fleeting and unreal it all is. It's all just about perspective. I just feel like it's not real. It's real, but only in the way it affects those around you. Fame or perceived success – it all comes from groupthink.

...

Have you thought about signing with a label?
There's no reason to. It's a dead industry.



Is it also because you like maintaining direct control over your career?
I don't really have control over my direct impression on people anymore. I used to be the person putting my CD in people's hands. But I'm kind of a mainstream artist now. Not by choice. Not by what I make or anything. But just by that ripple-effect shit.



When will we get an Acid Rap follow-up?
The whole point of Acid Rap was just to ask people a question: does the music business side of this dictate what type of project this is? If it's all original music and it's got this much emotion around it and it connects this way with this many people, is it a mixtape? What's an album these days, anyways? Cause I didn't sell it, does that mean it's not an official release? So I might not ever drop a for-sale project. Maybe I'll just make my money touring.[Intro: Chance The Rapper & Guests]

What's better than tripping is falling in love
What's better than Letterman, Leno, Fallon, and all the above
What's better than popping bottles trying to ball in the club
Is the first caveman pops with his son, ball and a club
What's better than paper is ballin' it up
What's better than followers is actually fallin' in love
What's better than frolicking, follies, fallin' in mud
Rolling in green pastures, wanderin', followin' love
What's better than eating is feeding your fam
What's better than meetings is missing meetings to meet with your fam
What's better than leaning and needing a Xan
Is hitting your xan dreaming a dream could mean leaving the land
What's better than yelling is hollerin' love
What's better than rhymes, nickels, dimes and dollars and dubs
Is dialing up your darling just for callin' her up
It ain't nothing better than fallin' in love
IGH!

[Chorus]
I've seen it come back, back, back and forth
You hit the nail right on top of the head
I know you've seen it all before
But when it looks you in the eyes
It ain't nothin' you could say but "that's love"
That's love
That's love
That's love
Say that's love, ooh ooh

Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
(IGH!)

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Introducin' Chance the Ruthless, trip 'shrooms and lucy
Dreams is lucid, loosely based on music, swallow my mucus
Hope your pussy get herpes and yo' ass get lupus
Deuces Douches, deuce deuce I'll shoot ya (BANG!)
Shoes might boot cha and a suit might suit cha
They be on bullshit but they really don't do shit
They use of allusion could confuse Confucius
Nasty, ashy, cigarette ashing, 'til my voice get raspy
Last week suspended, last night kissed Va$htie
Parleyed with Ashley, always in the hallway
So I never been classy (Ha ha ha)
Shut up!

[Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
(IGH, IGH, IGH, IGH!)

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Acid, Acid, get it? Acid, melts through plastic, I spit fired
Pad my palette, talkin' paper if this was work, I'd get higher
Pardon my mishaps, burp and get murdered
Fart and get bitch-slapped, like bourbon mixed with Jack
Lickety-split, look it! He slipped on a shell
From peelin' banana splits back, give me my Kit-Kat
Don't break me off shit, batch, fack is you mean bitch?
Zan with that lean bitch, xan with that lean bitch
Zen with that chakra I eat it like Idi Amin
Ya kna' wha' mean, hit me back when that mean shit

[Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
(IGH, IGH, IGH, IGH!)

[Verse 3: Action Bronson]
Introducin', it’s Bronsonlino
With my hair slicked back, I look like Rick Pitino
Three Japanese dykes in my El Camino
Lettin' trees blow, oh, I rep the East Coast
I got a team of hoes like Pat Summitt
I look like Arnold Schwarzenegger in a black Hummer
(Get to the chopper!)
I splash summer like a fast brother, with a number on his back
Ain’t no fumblin', in fact, I'm back, acid in my hat
Shoot, then pass the gat
It's at the bottom of the river in a plastic bag (baaaaag)
My new shorty got a gymnastic back
'87 emerald green on a classic jag
She had the cleft palate, I ordered chef’s salad
She had the club foot, with that little arm
I couldn’t help but laugh, she ordered Chicken Parm
I had the full Bulls warm-up with the Pippens on

[Outro: Action Bronson]
Suck my motherfucking dick
It's the young Randy Velarde
Queens, baby
Blow me[Chorus]
You're driving me crazy
Every little thing I do, you're...
You're driving me crazy
Every little thing I do, you're...
You're driving me crazy

[Verse: Chance The Rapper]
Now I'm a little too young to be drinkin' this much
I'm a little too dumb to be thinkin' this much
But it's... Chano, Mr. #1 Dubplate
All these niggas cupcakes, that's important update, yeah
But back to the matter at hand
I was the [?], used to walk on my friends
Mind's made up, never been on the fence
So everybody in here textin' their friends
(Get the fuck off your phone!)
The people start dancin' and romancin'Glory be to God. I claim this victory in the name of the Lord. I want to thank God for my mother and my father who've supported me since I was young. For Kiersten, for Kinsley, for all of Chicago. And I wanna thank God for putting amazing people in my life like Pete and Pat who have carried me since 2012. I know a lot of times I talk about my independence and people think it had something to do with... oh I'ma talk, y'all can play the music if you want. I wanna thank God for my team. I know people think that independence means you do it by yourself, but independence means freedom. I do it with these folks right here.  Glory be to God, I claim the victory in the name of the Lord, let's go!I got too much power
You watch too much Power
You smoke too much sour, take a shower (take a shower)
I'm a boss like Bowser
Get it from my bro like Al Ja'
Did it in a row like [? :59]
That's nostalgia
Did it without ya, did it without ya
I thought you sofa' cause so far you's a couch or futon lounger
Semi-villain, every episode you Kenny Krillin
Dyin', never doin' any killin'
Good riddance, ain't no Henny spillin
Been Benny the Bull can't pity the fool
Ain't no room for improvement when Timmy a tool
You can send him to school read him Winnie the Pooh
You can lead a horse to water but can't get in the pool
I will show these niggas good luck
They gone keep shootin' theyselves in the foot

[Verse 1]
Young black boy, how he got the labels scared?
A&R's like, "Chano, you ain't playin' fair!
You gon' set a bad example for the average bear
You a Yogi, you should idle while in child's position"
I be like, naw, these my sons, this prenatal care
I'mma show em how to make it here and make it fair
Take it there, they could kill me and I ain't gon' care
You is just an ankle weight, lighter than some angel cake
Sweeter than some maple syrup, easier than Ableton
Make a plate and make a player
Make em play it
Just don't count your sheep before they hatch
You chickens 'fore your eggs
Eat your dinner 'fore you say your prayer

[Verse 2]
Young tactician, just got my taxes finished
Beat the tortoise by a hair in an '04 Ford Taurus
On a spare with a wax finish
There's a lot of metaphors, you just lack vision
You just bad business
UH!
All your shit been lower case
Lower class, lower key
I'm the only minor minority in priority
Sippin' gin and tonic while I plot upon authority
Author of my horoscope, feeling like the oracle
Ain't no rules, nigga
IGH!

[Hook]
I'm back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this...I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dying, so my 9 with the shits

Moved to the neighborhood, I bet they don't stay for good, watch
Somebody will steal daddy's rollie
And call it the neighborhood watch
Pray for a safer hood, when my paper good, watch
Captain save the hood, Hood Saviour
Baby boy, still getting ID'ed for swishers
Mama still wash my clothes
Still with the save money militia
I'ma still watch my bros
Trapped in the middle of the map
With a little bit of rock and little bit of rap
That with a literary knack and a little shitty Mac
And like literally jack

[Hook] x 2
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dying, so my 9 with the shits

They murking kids, they murder kids here
Why you think they don't talk about it?
They deserted us here
Where the fuck is Matt Lauer at?
Somebody get Katie Couric in here
Prolly scared all the refugees
Away like we had a fucking hurricane in here
And we shooting whether it's dark or not
I mean the day is pretty dark a lot
Down here it's easier to find a gun
Than it is to find a fucking parking spot
No love for the opposition
Specifically a cop position
Cause they never been in our position
Getting violations for the nation, correlating, you dry snitching


[Hook] x 2
I'm riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dying, so my 9 with the streets

I know, you scared, you should ask us if we scared too
I know, you scared, me too
I know, you scared, you should ask us if we scared too
I know, you scared, me too

[Outro]
It just got warm out
It's the shit I've been worrying bout
I hope that it's storm in the morning
I hope that it's pouring out
I hate crowded beaches
I hate the sound of fireworks
And I ponder what's worse
Between knowing it's over and dying first
Cause everybody dies in the summer
Wanna say goodbye tell them while it's spring
I heard everybody dying in the summer
So pray to god for a little more spring
I know, you scared, you should ask us if we scared too
I know, you scared, me too[Produced by Flying Lotus]

[Verse]
22 Offs...
I'm off the nog, I'm off the Loko
I'm off that local, I'm on that global
I often had dreams of being locked in my momma's Volvo
Watching the garage burn down, I'm off the codo
I'm off the top, I'm off some pot, I'm off Ciroc, I'm off a lot
They gave me 10 days off, that's an awful lot
I was off campus but the officer
Told the office that he saw me from the parking lot
But it's all good, I'm off that
I'm just finna off his ass, off of the Ave while rocking all black
Dip off and hide the garbage bags in the dip spot
Just to make sure that I don't get caught
Buying hella bug spray, making sure I get off
They told me gon' rock it, I told them that it's lift off
How all my homies get caught? Picked off by a dick cop
Why you allowing hiccups? Why you just didn't slip off?
And now I'm at the precinct, and I'm off of my square
Having a white cop beat me while he offers me squares
You gon' torture me yeah? Well that's awfully fair
All for nothing, tryna tweak me like you offering years
Bitch I ain't scared, I'm already here
Tell ya partners and ya friends the next coffin is theirs
Guess what bitch? I'm from internal affairs
Looking for crooked cops to tweak so I can offer 'em years
Have me tweaking like I'm all full of fear (alright, I'm tweaking)[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, IGH!
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, IGH!

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Okie dokie, alkie, keep it lowkey like Thor lil bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack in an hour I'll ash my lucky
Tonight she just yelling "fuck me"
Two weeks she'll be yelling fuck me
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh generation above me, I know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting (BLAM!)

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank (Innanet)
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Innanet)

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere they be asking how's it going
Say the going's well, go figure, Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, checkmate, check me take me to the bedroom
Like she know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel shit
Shit-faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L
Elevated, train, and the craziest thing
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe, thumpin' that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
Rip, brain dead, take a tug and then pass

[Bridge: Vic Mensa]
I think we all addicted
Yeah, I think we all addicted
Really though, I think we all addicted
I think we all addicted

[Chorus 2: Vic Mensa]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I think we all addicted

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse 3: Twista]
I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter - juicy
Used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see, I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
That's the dual principle, sometimes I'ma be about some hoes
Sometimes I'ma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope see
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm offa codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
I'ma end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug, and I can't 'cause I'm stanking
Never too old for a spanking, IGH!

[Chorus 2: Vic Mensa]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I think we all addicted

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse 1]
Charlie Bartlett, John Bender
Class Switcher, Time Bender
Chance Bennett, a peculiar name
Graduation night teachers Ferris Bueller'd my name
You made a mixtape? Good job, I hope you get a good job
We was all outcasts, only listened to Good Mob
I performed at fun fair, fun fact
I'm never going back to school, been there, done that
They see my little 10 Day tape and my dumb raps
Don't call it impossible, if you really want that
They send my ass to summer school, don't call it a comeback
I just came to beat a bully's ass and get my lunch back
Chano y tequila you know you know you don't want that
I rap my songs in Spanglish, I wrap my weed in blunt wraps
Wrapped up in this one line I hope that shit get unwrapped
As if niggas was getting signed off of a line off one rap
Yo Vic, remember when they called us some freshmen niggas rapping?
Now I ain't gonna be a freshman and I'm rapping
I should've learned a lesson from all of this shit happening
I just look over to Justin for refreshments of the Captain
It's sipping when it's weak sauce, it's shots if it's cracking
Sip it when we tear up, and chug it if we laughing
Fuck it if we're fucked up I never thought of Chatham
Until the day they said I would have to chat without em
And I'm just in the studio hoping that it sounds right
Here's a brighter bulb for your limelight
And this is your night, homie, shine bright
This for everybody's fucking prom night

[Chorus]
And it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love
And it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love

[Verse 2]
Uh, yo this prom shit feel like the Grammy's yo
These pictures Granny took gonna make me ask where'd Granny go
So pass the Sanyo to Auntie Jo
And snap a couple candid's to the family, get some cameos
You can change the clocks but you can't change hours
I'm waiting on the day, Spring can't bring flowers
Let me ask for minutes from dad for those campaign hours
And pour these thirsty hoes a couple champagne showers
And hop up in that limo, the hood going dummy
The hood fucking love me, the hood think we lovely
So go and pop some bubbly, this right here's to loyalty
This to a moment's glimpse at royalty
This is for my momma Jan who spoiled me
Look what we've accomplished
Time flies, watches look like magnets on a compass
Before we dip, Gladys said a prayer over the limo
Bumping 10 Day with the Angels with Jesus shopping my demo
And rode up out of Chatham, the whole hood clapping
And damn it would be crazy if any of this shit had happened
But it didn't, I missed prom, I missed it to spin
I did a show at AKIN and I would do it again

[Chorus]
And it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love
And it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love

[Verse 3]
Look at, look at your business tux, all night airplane
Go and get your racist on, all white everything
I'm on my paper now, put that on my heading
I ain't even write this down I don't write errthing
I know y'all don't like everything
She want a night she can call her wedding
Giving Eskimo kisses, with some Eskimo bitches
Nose diving, going all night sledding
Coked out like "Don't change when you grow up
I hope you get some change when you blow up"
Cause honestly I've always loved the way that you could throw up
Rest up on my shoulder, float up flying lotus
"You deserve a warm towel, you deserve a soda
You deserve a quiet room, you deserve a sofa
You deserve a Ferrari and a matching tiara
And a hand to wipe away all that running mascara"
But I, I want to thank you for this prom night
Thank you for this prom night
Thank you for this prom night
I really enjoyed my prom night

[Chorus]
And it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love

[Outro]
So good, so right, hey baby
So good, so right
You know it feels so good
So good, so right
To be with you tonight
So good, so right
To be with you tonight
So good, so right
To be with you tonight[Verse: Chance the Rapper]

We want some heroes in our story
We need highlights for a night light
We need glory for a while
We want results, we want results
Hit our families, hit our folks, bombs bursting in air

Oh, say, can you see America face?
We share a pair of parents, took good care of the place
We just want narrators to pick up the narrative's pace
Put on a show for us, float for us
Make it easy, make some mo' for us
Save the day

We want a W, we tired of picking different sides
I got your jersey, just a different size
We all want you to be a buzzer beater
Find us a leader far from Silent Bob's and Cousin Skeeter's
Through the perilous fight, want you to be brave
We want us a hero, we need a teammate

[Hook: Chance the Rapper] x 2

People, people
We the people would like you to know
That wherever you go, we're right by your side
People, people
We the people would like you to know
That wherever you go, we're right by your side

[Hook: Chance the Rapper & James Fauntleroy]

People, people
We the people would like you to know
That wherever you go, we're right by your side[Verse 1]
What to get the man who has everything?
Tryna fit myself into a schedule and a wedding ring
Tryna eat everything
I was raised, it come across my plate then I better swing
Tryna turn confederate flags into confetti strings
I'm tryna back up my baby mama like Kevin Federline
Heard they got some nice-ass houses out there in Beverly
Never leave where I came from
I just need me some stockings and the chimney they could hang from
Photos so my kids can find out where they got their names from
Christmas cards so gorgeous other families wanna frame one
Real talk, I need a front yard, a backyard
A side yard, a side yard, inside bar, a dry bar
Nine cars and a garage, and it's on hella acres
I'm tired of people visitin', takin' the elevator
Well, we'll keep the elevator

[Chorus]
Love me forever, that's all I ask of you
Love me forever, that's all I ask of you

[Verse 2]
Don't gifts get re-wrapped?
That shit could get sticky like tree sap
I gave you free raps, that shit sound like free facts
Which is 'bout as common as free Blacks
Stuck like freeze tag from one of these random police stops
Look like the treetops soon as the breeze stops
And once the debris drops, the streets 400 degrees hot
Please, man, we needin' some freeze pops
What in the world for the man who has everything?
Man, West Chatham Park could use some better swings
Used to be disheveled, I went and shoveled everything
Tell Santa to show up to doors he never ring
He never ring

[Chorus]
Love me forever, that's all I ask of you
That's all I ask
Love me forever, that's all I ask of you

[Verse 3]
That baby is a genius
Don't teach him 'bout Santa 'til you teach him 'bout Jesus
Don't take him out the snow to try to take him on beaches
I swear it's enough leisure in this world to get lost
What's the point of gainin' chicken if you lose all the sauce?
What's the point of gainin' chicken if it can't get across?
Lost the cold hard cash, they said, "Damn, that boy soft"
Same niggas lost their souls in a fuckin' coin toss
I guess I cleaned up, Santa don't miss no names but I miss Fatimah
It's been a minute since I've seen her
Them the type of things I hate to bring up, just like the prenup
That shit be see-through like John Cena, Aquafina
But like the Christmas tape there's things that I gotta get clear
Like my papa ask the same question every year
"What to get for my boy who has everything?"
I said, "I'll take anything but everything," you know?

[Chorus]
Love me forever, that's all I ask of you
Love me forever, that's all I ask of you
Love me forever, that's all I ask of you
Love me forever, that's all I ask of you[Hook: Detail, Lil Wayne, and Chance the Rapper]
You can look me in my face
I ain't got no worries (I ain’t word) x3
See them shroomies keep me up
So I ain't got no worries (I ain’t word) x3
You see money right there
Yeah that's (me) right there
Yeah that's (me) right there
And we ain't got no worries
You see pussy right there
Redbone mangos right there
See them shroomies right there
We ain't got no worries

[Verse 1]
D. Rose on that ass, that means back again
I hit my Zan so hard
Man, I've been practicing
I'm going straight to the league, and not by accident
Don't get your ass kicked in
I'll hoop in Shaqs and Timbs
Chit chat with Chris Mintz-Plasse
And laugh at Jags and rims
T-T-Y-L-ing the labels and L-O-L-ing they friends
Hello Hell and Heaven, you haven't heard the half of it
Have at it half-happy
30-something year old, broke graduate
Over the wave like du-rags,getting paper like dude rap
Nineteen, making that "I could be damn near fucking Erykah Badu" rap
Girbaud flow is too strapped
My screws loose, I'm too slapped
Just got this bitch too turnt
Just got my nose 2Pac'd
L.A Reid like, "Who's that?
Jimmy Iovine like, "Who's that?
Whole world like, "Who's that?
Whole hood like ‘dude ass’
I'm from little shorties with the shot up shirt
Where babies get kilt like a Scottish skirt
95-ing down the Ryan
And I'm flying, skirrt
Keep on asking if I'm trying niggam I ain't word

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Unreluctant optimist, most poppingest
Got popular,try topping this, Triceratops
BJs from baby bopping bitches
Throat lozenges
Massaging it, no touching it
Okay, touch on it
But don’t rush on it
Ration it, passionate
While imagining me smashing it
Dash out at like 4:30,hands smelling like potpourri
They ain’t give my nigga no jury, so I don’t give no nigga no mercy
When my little fucking brother rap better than you
My shit get your girl way wetter than you
You rap veterans you, my nerdy brethren you
Stuff you in a fucking locker, 10 Day letterman you
You wanna jock me, jockers (AAH)
My style’s fathering you
I know it’s bothering you
Probably an anomaly
But it’s probably niggas that’s probably starving for new shit you could sound like
That’s that shit that I don’t like
But I ain’t really worried
I’m a wordy motherfucker
I could hurry
But I’m buried in her pussy from the last tape

[Hook][Hook]
Ice, melting in my chain
Pretty as my hair
Ugly as my name
Dirty as my gold
Comfy as my chair
Ugly is my name
Ugly is my name

[Verse]
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
My sword look just like Michael's
He lent it to me, this a house of God
I'm just leasing, he rent it to me
This sentence he penned it too
That's a Gmail, he sent it to me
I can send you his contact, hit him if you in combat
Hit him if you in traffic, even if there ain't no static
That's my G, he got me shinin'
My hair, he made it tangled
My seed, don't need no lining
A halo fits on an angel
And if the shoe fits, I'll tie his and let the kiddie rap
Finally give the city back, and ask God for a piggy-back
Up on his shoulders I notice, I'm within earshot
I yell, "Thanks for makin' us in your image
You got a good sense of hubris"[Verse 3 (Freestyle)]
Vodka in my Redbull can, very formal
Shot a porno on a red bull can
Don't be jealous that's the shit that got the devil Dan
Yeah, you got one bigger nigga I got cero hairs
Cheers and dash and dash and Detroit at your rescue, man
But you love the way I treat you extra, and
Got me fillin' up her [?]
And I ate Cheerios for dinner
I broke like 40 balls I'm a cereal bowl killa
Manilla
Fear in an animal
They like "Channo, you're an animal!"
Here's a bunch mushrooms run in the woods and go find ya spirit animal
Um
Hard to devour
Our hearts turnin' sour
I wanna put my twins in a tower so I can hoop my basement and swim in my shower
Choke hold in my wine glass
Propose a toast to the noggin'
I got holes in my socks and coal in my stockin'
Channo was on dirt with all the [?] kids that shot him
So I rode to the North Pole with a poll and I shot him
Batman, Gotham, Autumn
I oughta start selling em'
But I didn't earn that

[Outro]
*Chance's Nana Ad Lib*[Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
I'ma do my own thing
I'm finna buy a ringtone, then let the phone ring
I decided that I gotta do my own thing
Yeah, yeah, I just gotta do my own thing
Do my own thing

[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
Please don't hit me in my DM
Promise that my BM gonna slide when she see 'em
I know she gonna see 'em 'cause I'm defa finna show her
Take her to the culprit then I take her to the store (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
She just like my personal space, got a circular waist
Pull my shirt when she work, work, work, work, work
If you work in my space, better keep that shit 'fessional
I don't like to be bothered when I work, work, work, work
Please leave me the fuck alone, new fiancée, that's my cologne
Doin' too much and sayin' too much, that's how y'all ass end up alone
I'ma just pimp off, you a send-off, I don't really ever like to get involved
Got a baby, got a house, got in-laws, go and kick rocks

[Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
I'ma do my own thing
I'm finna buy a ringtone, then let the phone ring
Just let it ring, ring, ring, let it ring, ring, ring, let it ring, ring, ring
I decided that I gotta do my own thing
Yeah, yeah, I just gotta do my own thing
Do my own thing, yeah

[Verse 2: Joey Purp (Chance the Rapper)]
Okay, don't mind if it don't pay me, it ain't my biz
How you gon' raise yo' voice?
Gon' raise yo' money, won't raise yo' kids? (What?)
Bad little bitty in the city that I'm in (Yeah)
When I go and travel, I might have to take her with
She say she like how the car stop, but the rims don’t
Ain't wanna leave but I had to go, like Trey Songz
I was 18 with a '98 (Yup) sellin' 28s
Now I'm 25, sellin' 16s (Yup), it's a hunnid ways
My new girl a freak, she my type, she unique
Make her sang when we bang, skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet
Tell my ex it's a dub, that's a wop, that's unlikely
Put a bustdown on my wifey, like Gucci Mane, so icy

[Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
I'ma do my own thing
I'm finna buy a ringtone, then let the phone ring
Just let it ring, ring, ring, let it ring, ring, ring, let it ring, ring, ring
I decided that I gotta do my own thing
Yeah, yeah, I just gotta do my own thing
Do my own thing, yeah[Produced by Thomas Foolery]

That shit cray, that shit dead, that shit fake, plastic head
Cassius Clay at his head, atta boy, atta kid
I'ma need a napkin, cook 'em up
And he gon' need a Aspirin, hook him up
Niggas was busy scrappin', put 'em up
I was too busy rapping, good as fuck
Niggas don't act like grown ups
When niggas don't get to grow up
Niggas don't wanna throw hands
That's what made me wanna throw up
But these young gunners ain't nothin' but young stunners
And niggas see you as come ups so niggas just wanna run up
Niggas asking what up, I said on my soul I'm a hundred
My niggas stay in the low end, the others stay in the hundreds
My daddy throw me the hands, my momma told me to love 'em
My neighbors told me they hunting, I hope I make it through summer
They stole one of my niggas, I should have seen that one coming
My priest told me it's angels, my niggas told me its nothing
I'm thinking about my nigga he thinking before he die
I’m going to war with fate and I’m going to war with God
I'm burning up all the papers cuz all the reporters lied
I call him my lil' homie he brought him a .45
Brown boys are dying, and none of ‘em were for business
And all of em' love they mommas, and all of they mommas miss 'em
And this shit is just stupid, this shit is fucking senseless
The news shouldn't support it, this shit is getting expensive

[Outro]
I don't know why I sleep with my eyes wide
Hoping that I find you
I don't know why I sleep with my eyes wide
Hoping that I find you
(And now for something completely different)
And I don't know why I sleep with my eyes wide
Hoping that I find you
And hoping that I find you
I been hoping that I find you
I'm missing you

My druggy, love me, when I'm ugly, hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy, I'm your hubby
Let's get lost
Let's get lost

[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
Damn, I'm in so deep, girl, probably 'cause you're empty
You can't even speak (IGH!) Damn, your mouth so minty
Ooh your mama hate me, daddy wouldn't let you
If he ever met me, if he ever met you
Put that shit behind us and put this in your sinus
Mine is all up in my gums, minus all that shit it's lined with
I say oh-oh-oh-ohh, you been scratchin', you been fiendin'
I'ma fix you, I'ma fuck you, I'ma get rid of them demons
It's my

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Damn, I need a minute - aight, lehgo
She fell in love, it fell apart - aight, let go
She met her match, I let her match
She lit her match, she let me smoke
Yeah me mad petty, yeah me bogus
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah me know
Yeah she knew too (IGH!), it made her love it
Her pussy like me, her heart like "fuck it"
So dance for daddy like Gator
Ain't no partners on this trip
And lose yourself in my room
And find yourself in my grip
I'm sayin'

[Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
My druggy
When I'm ugly
Hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy
I'm your hubby
Let's get lost, let's get lost

[Verse 3: Noname]
I blessed myself inside your arms one day
Swear to God there I was when the dress
And the silver buttons fade away
Miss Mary Mattress, geriatrics
Fuck me into open caskets, I wanna die with this
I wanna stop seeing my psychiatrist
She said "pill pop, baby girl 'cause I promise you, you tweaked
The empty bottled loneliness, this happiness you seek"
The masochism that you preach
Practice backflips, tragic actress
On a movie with no screen
When the only time he loves me is naked in my dreams

[Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
My druggy
When I'm ugly
Hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy
I'm your hubby
Let's get lost, let's get lost
IGH![Hook]
I'm coming for your spot, bitch
I'm coming for your spot

[Verse 1]
I ain't slept since I graduated
I'm so tired of this school shit
Niggas talking all that glad you made it
I'm getting tired of the bullshit
Posted like facebook walls
Ask me if I care how her face look, naw
Snap back to reality, back pack and a snapple
We so far from moving jeans and backpacks from the mall
And Chance laughing em off, hand smackin em all xanax in a ball
Shoulda said lean but the lean put on the house if the track buy me a couch
No back pack in the fall, no plan back for me to fall
No man left for me to ball up
It's too risky, it's just a mistake
So crispy, is that a mixtape? Is that an album? Shutup

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
For your spot, for your top
I'm off of mine
I'm off the line, sometimes you thought I wrote it
I did, no that's bogus I'm lying but I'm focused like a ford
Can you afford? A verse from the man of the yord? Of the year?
Next it's New York next it's back to Cali, shouts to Dally Auston
I do this often, and shouts to Austin the video's awesome
They wanna know more, they wanna know why but he flossing
Now you know I'm lying now you know I'm offing eat em up lunch em
If you fuck up better punch em' is that still a freestyle?
IDK I eat cake, I still cake, with my bitch
Ripping off the top, throw up the fists for niggas that still rapping that bitch
Attack shit all and stack shit, it's still so fun to play in my car

[Outro]
I'm coming for your spot, bitch
I don't give a fuck about you or any of your shit that you...
I'm coming for your spot[Intro]
Oooh, snow is fallin'
Oooh, winter is callin'
Winter is callin' you, oooh
Oooh, snow is fallin'
Oooh, winter is callin'
Winter is callin' you, oooh, oooh

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Old man, sittin' on the corner
Old man, been there for years
Old man, weepin' on the corner
Tryna find what's his
Old man weepin' in the corner
Cold again, it snowed again
Old man waitin' by the corner
Waitin' on winter again
He needs help
He needs help
He needs Heaven
He needs Heaven
Old man waitin' by the corner
Old man drinkin' by the corner
Tryna find somewhere warmer
Some place that he can get warmer tonight
Winter's coming
Winter's coming
Old man sittin' on the corner
Tryna find what's his

[Verse 2: Noname]
When I was your craving and only this mattered
This jingle bell sanctified, sugared in batter
Our heathenous appetite, ever and after
Like Christmas will save us and bathe us in rapture
Mr. Happy, Mr. Matrimony
Mr. Half-A-Block-Away-From-Stony
I love you
There's something hauntin', dauntin' 'bout your presence
Casper essence, ghost of Christmas past
Phantom of unraveling his laugh
Opera, string quartet
Curtain's up, but the whole room darkened up
I know winter was callin' you
Me baby, my baby
He Chris with the Kringle in rooms filled with ladies
They lovin' his presence, a blessin' a blessin'
I'm guessin' you happy
I'm knowin' you answered
When winter was callin' you[Cocoa Butter Kisses]
[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, IGH!
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, IGH!

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Okie dokie, alkie, keep it lowkey like Thor lil bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack in an hour I'll ash my lucky
Tonight she just yelling "fuck me"
Two weeks she'll be yelling fuck me
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh generation above me, I know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting (BLAM!)

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank (Innanet)
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Innanet)

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere they be asking how's it going
Say the going's well, go figure, Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, checkmate, check me take me to the bedroom
Like she know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel shit
Shit-faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L
Elevated, train, and the craziest thing
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe, thumpin' that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
Rip, brain dead, take a tug and then pass

[Bridge: Vic Mensa]
I think we all addicted
Yeah, I think we all addicted
Really though, I think we all addicted
I think we all addicted

[Chorus 2: Vic Mensa]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I think we all addicted

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse 3: Twista]
I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter - juicy
Used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see, I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
That's the dual principle, sometimes I'ma be about some hoes
Sometimes I'ma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope see
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm offa codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
I'ma end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug, and I can't 'cause I'm stanking
Never too old for a spanking, IGH!

[Chorus 2: Vic Mensa]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I think we all addicted

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
Angels, na, na, na, na, ah

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
I got my city doing front flips
When every father, mayor, rapper jump ship
I guess that's why they call it where I stay
Clean up the streets, so my daughter can have somewhere to play
I'm the blueprint to a real man
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man
I ain't goin' to hell or to Hillman
Igh, Igh, Igh, Igh, for my real fans
I got caught up with a little Xan
Can't stop me but it slow me though
Yeah a nigga famous, you don't know me though
But every DJ still play me though
Damn man, I don't even need a radio
And my new shit sound like a rodeo
Got the old folks dancing the Do-si-do
'Til they fuck around and sign me to OVO
Oooh, I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief, they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split an atom with me
I even had Steve giving out apples for free

[Chorus: Saba]
They was talking "woo this woo wap da bam"
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded

[Post-Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Who is you, and who the fuck is you, and who is him?
All of a sudden, woo wap da bam
You can't touch me
Na, na, na, na, I got angels
I got angels

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
I ain't change my number since the seventh grade
This for my day one, ten years, seven days
A week, niggas never tired on they Kevin Gates
And if they rest in peace they bunny hopping heaven's gates
It's too many young angels on the southside
Got us scared to let our grandmommas outside
You gon' make me take the campers way downtown
You gon' make me turn my BM to my housewife
I just had a growth spurt
It done took so long, my tippy toes hurt
You can keep the nose ring, I don't have to soul search
I'm still at my old church, only ever sold merch
Grandma say I'm Kosher, momma say I'm culture
GCI, 1-0-7-5, angel goin' live
Power 92, angel, juke, angel gon' juke
GCI, 1-0-7-5, goin' live
Power 92, angel gon' juke, juke, juke, juke

[Chorus: Saba & Chance The Rapper]
They was talking "woo this woo wap da bam"
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me, they keep me surrounded
Wap the bam (na, na, na, na)
I got angels
(I got angels) I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded
Na, na, na, na
I got, I got angels
They was talking "woo woo, this woo wap da bam"
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me, they keep me surrounded

[Post-Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Who is you, and who the fuck is you, and who is him?
All of a sudden, woo wap da bam
You can't touch me
Na, na, na, na, I got angels
I got, I got angels

[Outro: Vocals]
Na, na
Na, na
I got, I got[Verse 1]
I should be downtown, trippin on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is this that got you all gassed up?
Changin' your opinions on me
I was only gone for the last two months
But you don't have the time to wait on me

[Hook]
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I can do
But that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're throwing dirt on my name, on purpose
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it

[Post-Hook]
Feel a way, feel a way, feel a way
I've stopped listenin' to things you say
Cause you don't mean them anyway
Feel a way, feel a way, feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way

[Verse 2]
We need to breathe
There's more to life than hearing stuff and being mean to me
We had to let go of us to show ourselves what we can be
But that just didn't sit well with me
Tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Throwing dirt on my name, in public
You don't feel no way, on purpose
I'm messing up all of Drake's words, on purpose.. careful
Careful
Be careful
Be careful
You could never be too careful

(I'm not a singer but BBC got me up very early in the morning)

[Verse 3]
Keep ya head away from windows
Keep your arms inside the ride
Trust me with ya body, trust me with ya life
Banging on the windows, baby come inside
Certainly in trouble, maybe you should hide
I'mma tell you like
Don't you look up to me, don't trust a word I say
Don't you end up like me, if you learn one thing today
Don't you look up to me, don't trust a word I say
Don't you end up like me, if you learn one thing today

[Outro]
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things this way
Instead of the other way
Instead of the other way
Feel a way, feel a way, young parents feel this way
Maybe we just should have did things this way
Instead of the other way
Instead of the other way

I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
I don't make songs for free, I make 'em for freedom
Don't believe in kings, believe in the Kingdom
Chisel me into stone, prayer whistle me into song air
Dying laughing with Krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair
Jesus' black life ain't matter, I know I talked to his daddy
Said you the man of the house now, look out for your family
He has ordered my steps,  gave me a sword with a crest
And gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath

[Hook: Jamila Woods +  Chance The Rapper]
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
Don't be mad
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up
(Good God)
The blessings come down
Good God
When the praises go up (Good God) the blessings come down
( the blessings come down)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap)
The blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Good God)

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
They booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor
With the big wide windows, with the suicide doors
Ain't no blood on my money, ain't no Twitter in Heaven
I know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visitin' Heaven
I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions
Like my ex-girl getting pregnant
And her becoming my everything
I'm at war with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs
I never forged it or forfeited, I'm a force to be reconciled
They want four-minute songs
You need a four-hour praise dance performed every morn
I'm feeling shortness of breath, so Nico grab you a horn
Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh!
(Good God)

[Hook: Jamila Woods, Byron Cage + (Chance The Rapper)]
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him till I'm gone

When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(the blessings come down)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your blessings?)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your miracle?)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready, are you ready?)
(Are you ready, are you ready?)
(Are you ready, are you ready?)

[Verse 3]
This is not the castle this is just the casa tonight
Ain’t no Nala so my Simba ain't gon’ be Mufasa tonight
Only dust and shadows comin' from la cucaracha tonight
But if you eva in the hood like Mr. Rogers, hit my

We used to roll at the Rink, we used to roll at the Rink
I used to talk way too much, you used to know everything
You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you
You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too
Your big brother foot work, your play sister Juke
The Rink was the place, but in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me, too worried 'bout Frooties and Chews
'Til I found out all the shawdy's with cooties was cute and realized what booties could do

[Chorus: Towkio]
We gon' get it poppin', we gon' get it jukin'
We gon' throw a party, and we ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend, came up for the weekend
Rollin' with the parties, so tell me what you thinkin'
So we gon' have a juke jam, we gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do, I'll get close to you
I remember you, you used to, I remember you, 'cause

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
We've got so much history
Baby (juke), maybe (juke)
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe (juke) I'm crazy (juke)

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
We never rolled at the Rink, we would just go to the Rink
You ain't buy tokens no more, you just hip roll at the Rink
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him
But when they play "Take You Down", Chris Brown, I am his stand-in
I mean it's just dancing, it's harmless as fuck
Then I put my waist through your hips and your legs in my arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor, all the kiddies stop skating
To see grown folks do, what grown folks do when they grown and they dating

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
We've got so much history
Baby (that's right, that's right), maybe (that's right, that's right)
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe I'm crazy, crazy about you

[Chorus: Towkio]
We gon' get it poppin', we gon' get it jukin'
We gon' throw a party, and we ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend, came up for the weekend
Rollin' with the parties, so tell me what you thinkin'
So we gon' have a juke jam, we gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do, I'll get close to you
I remember you, you used to, I remember you, 'cause

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
We've got so much history
Baby (juke), maybe (juke)

Introducin' Chance the Ruthless
Trip 'shrooms and lucy
Dreams is lucid
Loosely based on music
Swallow my mucus
Hope your pussy get herpes and yo' ass get lupus
Deuces Douches. deuce deuce I'll shoot ya
Shoes might boot cha and a suit might suit cha
They be on bullshit but they really don't do shit
They use of illusion could confuse Confucius
Nasty, ashy, cigarette ashing, 'til my voice get raspy
Last week suspended
Last night kissed Va$htie
Parleyed with Ashley
Always in the hallway, so I never been classy
Shut up

[Hook]
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Igh

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Acid acid, get it? Acid
Melts through plastic, I spit fired
Pad my palette, talkin' paper
If this was work, I'd get higher-ed
Pardon my mishaps, burp and get murdered
Fart and get bitch-slapped, like bourbon mixed with jack
Lickety-split, lickety-slipped on a shell
From peelin' banana split backs
Give me my Kit-Kat
Don't break me off shit, batch, fack is you mean bitch?
Zan with that lean bitch, zan with that lean bitch
Zen with that chakra
I eat it like Idi Amin, you know what I mean
Hit me back when that mean shit
Shut up

[Extended Hook]

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
Vodka in my Redbull can, very formal
Shot a porno on a rebel cam
Don't be jealous that's the shit that got the devil damned
Yeah you got one banger? Nigga I got several hands
Chance and Dash and Dash and Detro at your rescue, man
Don't you love the way I treat you extra special and
Got me feeling upper echelon
And I ate cheerios for dinner
I broke like 40 bowls I'm the cereal bowl killer
Manilla
Fearing an animal
They like Chano your an animal
Here's a bunch of mushrooms go run in the woods and find your spirit animal
I'm, hard to devour
Hearts turning sour
I want to put my twins in a tower
So I could hoop in my basement and swim in my shower
Choke holding my wine glass
Propose a toast to the noggin
I got holes in my socks and coal in my stocking
Santa was on dirt with all the poor kids in Chatham
So I rode to the north pole with a pole and I shot him
Batman, Gotham
Autumn
I ought to start selling them
But I ain't even on that
Nananananannanananananannaanananan[Intro]
Watch cases are convenient hiding places
The value of drugs [?] is enormous
Recently, a huge supply of heroin was taken
It was concealed in a powdery, harmless shipment of 35 barrels of olive oil
The deadly drug was burned in an incinerator of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing
And more vicous, more deadly than these soul destroying drugs is the menace of marijuana

[Chorus]
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down

[Verse 1]
Uh, here’s a tab of acid for your ear
You’re the plastic, I’m the passion and the magic in the air
The flabbergasted avalanche of ambulances near
The labyrinth of Pan’s Lab is adamantly here
No assignments, book of rhyming and I’m drawing doodles
I should rhyme rhyme with Ramen Noodles
Ramadan, I’m the don of the diamond jewels
Fond of finding a way to kindly tell these toddlers toodles
I’m a kamikaze and I’m kinda cuckoo
I could write a fucking book, non-Kamasutral
You niggas goofies, it's a conflict that is kinda crucial
Caught you on the 9 in all blue yelling, "I’m a neutral"
But I’ma let the bull pass like matadors
Versus a Minotaur, verse is a metaphor
Metamorphoses and I’m a fuckin anamorph
I used to go to school with Anna Fedele and Danny Whorf
Remember I used to bang with the bad ones
'Til my grandmama told on her grandson
Mama said that I was way too handsome
To be throwing the hand’s son, breaking walls like Samson
But I’ma throw a tantrum 'til I’m on every Samsung
Sanyo and handheld and handgun
Please put ya lighter’s up 'til life is up, then light it up
And slice a cut, the night is young, it’s nice enough
The nicest blunt, the nicest stuff
My niggas out here rapping a lot
I know you think you on, hiding Reggie sacks in your socks
I hang with niggas, whole jab in the jock
.4’s for 15, yeah my niggas, we be taxing a lot
Only the goofies, though, choking on a doobie though
My eyes do be low, two be rolled, remember days of the Rufio
Remember the Days of Chan-Man and the Skeeter Man
Brrang dang to Lil' B and bang a-rang to Peter Pan

[Chorus]
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
Uh, uh, uh-uh

[Verse 2]
Light a joint, or spliff it if you classy
Split a swisha witcha nigga if you ask me
There's no skipping, hit it vividly and pass me
Don’t answer about your asthma
Or your issues or your Ashleys
It’s a quarter to imminent, ten minutes to infinite
Rims, Henny, and reminisce, nostalgia and M&M's
Feminine’s getting intimate, cinnamon tone women
And homies could get they dividends, all broads is frivolous
Damn, is he illiterate, literal syndicate
Illegitimate, idiot, gangbanger-affiliate
Sick twisted prick, dick sadistic
Son of a biscuit, man fuck this shit
Hold up, I need a roll up
Better yet, I need to roll up
Mama always glad Mary showed up
After the show, let's put a zone up
Zone out, smoke up, blunts, bongs and [?]
Yep, haha

[Bridge]
I smoked too many Js right now
I smoked too many Js right now, right now, right now
I burned too many brain cells down
I burned too many brain cells down

[Chorus]
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I'm burning up my brain cells now
I'm burning up my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down

I believe that if I fly, prolly end up somewhere in paradise
I believe that if I fly, I'll prolly end up somewhere in paradise

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Chancelor the rapper, Chatham the hood
Santa to children, had to bag up the goods
They say I'm savin' my city, say I'm stayin' for good
They screamin', "Chano for mayor," I'm thinkin' maybe I should
Fucked a few A&R's, told 'em, "Bitch I can’t wife you"
Told your ass since day one, I don't like labels or titles
I'm a rascally rabbit, I know that tricks is for addicts
That need fixes for habits, in love with carrots and cabbage
I'm a savage, established, bad bitch magnet, I'm magic
Your majesty, I'm majestic, I think my message is massive
Think you passive aggressive
I think you passed up your prime
Think you passed up your chance to be Chance
Now pass it to Arab
I should have rhymed it with rhyme
Ain't we been here before?
Ain't my principal told me that I can't rap at that show?
Then I rapped at that show, simple as that
Got a complex from Complex off of the simplest raps
And it goes like...

[Pre-Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Fannin' the fire, hands is up higher
Cannot believe it, damn I'm a rider
Ridin' on twenties, twenty years prior, I couldn't buy a
Forget it you get it
God is so awesome, devil's a liar
Take 'em to church, but I need a choir

[Chorus 1: Jeremih]
I believe that if I fly, prolly end up somewhere in paradise
I believe that if I fly, I'll prolly end up somewhere in paradise

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Blow out your speakers, roll some more loud
That's the sound of the reefer, I think my parents is proud
Thank my fans in the bleachers
Think my teachers need features
I think I'm walkin' with Jesus, I knew my feet wouldn't drown
I been close to the edge, I been trippin' and stuff
Somebody slipped me a mickey but I ain't giving a fuck
Really, a milli'? How 'bout six billion more
Or I'm outie like how'd he cut that umbilical cord?
As I smoke herb in this Uber suburban dressed in an Urban Outfitters
Shirt and burgundy pair of Jordans
I asked the acid if words were worth worryin' over
Her explanation seemed agitated
She said let me answer your question
With some questions questionin' yours
Like why the devil can't get you?
And why these labels can't catch you?
And why'd he make you so special, why did he bless you?
Think about it
I woke up this mornin', I woke up this mornin'
Gotta smile when I say that shit, I woke up this mornin'
Go!

[Pre-Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
Fannin' the fire, hands is up higher
Cannot believe it, damn I'm a rider
Ridin' on twenties, twenty years prior, I couldn't buy a
Forget it you get it
God is so awesome, devil's a liar
Take 'em to church, but I need a choir

[Chorus 2: R. Kelly]
I believe, I believe, there's somewhere out there for us all
There's a paradise (there is a paradise)
I believe that if I die, I'll see my homies somewhere in paradise
(I'll see 'em somewhere in paradise)

[Pre-Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Fannin' the fire, hands is up higher
Cannot believe it, damn I'm a rider
Ridin' on twenties, twenty years prior, I couldn't buy a
Forget it you get it
God is so awesome, devil's a liar
Take 'em to church, but I need a choir

[Outro: Choir]
I believe, I believe, I believe
Somewhere in paradise
I believe, I believe, I believe
Somewhere in paradise
I believe, I believe, I believeEDIT: The song has been officially released - check the lyrics out here



Hey Genius family

Via Twitter, Chance expressed his desire to keep this song hidden from the public. Like he said, he has no labels, publishers or legal team to help him handle these situations. Let's honor his wish and not share the song until HE wants it to be shared[Intro: Ha Ha Davis + Chance The Rapper]
You don't want zero problems, big fella!
Yep! Igh!

[Refrain: Chance The Rapper]
If one more label try to stop me
It's gon' be some dreadhead niggas in ya lobby, huh huh

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Ooh, watch me come and put the hinges in their hands
Countin' Benjis while we meetin', make 'em shake my other hand
Milly rockin', scoopin' all the blessings out my lap
Bitch I know you tried to cheat, you shoulda never took a nap, hey
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?
Fuck you thought it was?
You talk that talk that make a lame ass nigga fall in love
Not me, though, bitch you can keep those
Bruh, I'm at your head like Craig did Deebo
Don't tweak, bro, it's never sweet, ho
My shooters come for free, so

[Refrain: Chance The Rapper & Lil Wayne]
If one more label try to stop me
It's gon' be some dreadhead niggas in ya lobby, huh huh

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & 2 Chainz]
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
Yep, yep!
Pull up in the new thing, I'm like
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
(Yeah, 2 Chainz)
They be like, "There he go!"

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
You old Petey Pablo, take your shirt off
Wave 'round your head like a helicopter
I ain't put enough weed in the blunt
All you do is smoke tobacco
Where the hell you get them from?
Yeezy said he ain't make them
My niggas chasin' bounty hunters
And gettin' chased by their baby mommas
My first tat was on my stomach
Got a pocket full of money
And a mind full of ideas
Some of this shit may sound weird
Inside of the Maybach
Look like it came out of Ikea
Run shit like diarrhea
Big yacht, no power steering
Aye, aye, captain
I'm high, captain
I'm so high
Me and God dappin'
This is my blessin'
This is my passion
School of hard knocks
I took night classes

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
Yep, yep!
Pull up in the new thing, I'm like
They be like, "There he go!"

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I got problems bigger than these boys
My deposits, they be on steroids
Lord, free the Carter, niggas need the Carter
Sacrificin' everything, I feel like Jesus Carter
Hold up, I got this sewed up, my soda poured up
My woes up, I'm flippin' those bucks, they doing toe tucks
I rolled up and let the smoke puff
I lay down, toes up
Hold up, get too choked up when I think of old stuff
Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns
In the streets my face a coupon
Her pussy too warm
All these bitches come to do harm
Just bought a new charm
Fuck the watch, I buy a new arm, you lukewarm
I'm Uncle Luke with the hoes
Pretty bitches, centerfolds
Tippy toes around my crib in they robes, just their robes
Half a milli' in the safe, another in the pillowcase
Codeine got me movin' slower than a caterpillar race
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?
What you thought it was?
I just popped five Percocets and only caught a buzz
And if that label try to stop me
There gon' be some crazy Weezy fans waitin' in the lobby
Mula, baby

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Chance The Rapper]
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
They say so, ridin' with the payo'
They be like, "There he go!"

You are very special
You're special too
Everyone is special
This I know is true
When I look at you
You are very special
You're special too
Everyone is special
This I know is true
When I look at you[Nick Cannon]
I got three babies, and everyone know it
Rac', Monroe and a little Golden

[Chance The Rapper]
And a little poet, I think that I win
I hope that you and Mariah split up them twins

[Nick Cannon]
Split up them twins, we gone all the time
I see them everyday that I can rhyme

[Chance The Rapper]
Every I rhyme, I do my lines
I think you should stick down to drumline

[Nick Cannon]
Stick to drumline, I got more movies tho
Matter a fact I just did three in a row

[Chance The Rapper]
Three in a row and I think that that's perfect
But I think you should take off that damn turban

[Nick Cannon]
Take off this turban, man how can you say that
I don't even know because you don't wanna play that
I'll take you down, this is my crown
Rapping from New York, now how that sound

[Chance The Rapper]
It's going down, I came to play
I came to clown, I came to say
I think it's cool that you play lockers
That you play.... is that soccer?

[Nick Cannon]
Yes I play soccer
And you know feel it
Because when I kick it I pick up and kill it
Man you gone deal with it
Man I'm just spill with it
Nick Cannon the realest and you know that I'm the illest so...

Pick up and kill it and kill it and kill it

[Chance The Rapper]
I am not one of them goofy ass niggas
I think that you take off pants with them zippers
I know that I am the coolest, the realest
And I can go realer, I'm from Chi-Town
When I do my shit, I never write down
I'm off the top and I'm wearing my crown
This is New York, but I think it's my town[Produced by Jake One]

[Verse]
Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young; just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back, like "That's not your jersey?"
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich
'Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed, eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic's still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still thinks I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face

[Outro]
I am a new man, I am sanctified
Oh, I am holy, I have been baptized
I have been born again, I am the White Light

And we back
And we back, and we back, and we back, and we back, and we, huh
And we back, and we back, nah, nah, nah

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Hey, this ain't no intro, this the entree
Hit that intro with Kanye and sound like André
Tryna turn my baby mama to my fiancée
She like music, she from Houston like Auntie Yoncé
Man my daughter couldn't have a better mother
If she ever find another, he better love her
Man I swear my life is perfect, I could merch it
If I die I'll prolly cry at my own service, igh-igh!
It was a dream, you could not mess with the Beam
This is like this many rings
Y'all know wha' mean?
This for the kids of the king of all kings
This is the holiest thing
This is the beat that played under the Word
This is the sheep that ain't like what it heard
This is officially first
This is the third

[Chorus: Kanye West & Chance The Rapper]
This is the bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom
Music is all we got
Oh, bom-bom-bom
So we might as well give it all we got
This is the bom-bom-bom (huh)
Bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom
Music all we got, got, got
Music is all we got
Oh, bom-bom-bom
So we might as well give it all we got

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper, Chance The Rapper & Kanye West]
Ayy, ayy, I get my word from the sermon
I do not talk to the serpent
That's the holistic discernment
Daddy said I'm so determined
Told me these goofies can't hurt me
I just might make me some earl tea
I was baptized like real early
I might give satan a swirlie
Wish I could tell you it's ready
Tell you it's ready today
They don't give nothin' away
You gotta fight for your way
And that don't take nothin' away
'Cause at the end of the day

[Chorus: Kanye West & Chance The Rapper]
Music is all we got
Music is all we got
Music is all we got
Oh, bom-bom-bom
So we might as well give it all we got
Music is all we got (huh, huh)
Music is all we got (huh, huh)

[Outro: Kanye West & Chicago Children's Choir]
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
Music

We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
Music
Music is all we got

[Produced by Kanye West & The Social Experiment][Intro]
If this is my last shh- my last shit
Uhh, it definitely be mad important
And it would have to sound like a Prince song

[Chorus]
Still a chain-smoking, name dropping
Good looking, muh' fucking, motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken, Frank Ocean listening, stain hitting
Satin woodgrain gripping, paint dripping, motha, shut your mouth

[Verse 1]
Somebody pray for the god, oh lord
I wonder what Michael's on
Son jammin' to his shit, rappin' trappin' trippin' 'cid
And sniffing glue and chewing Vicodin
Shoulda died, yelling YOLO was a lie
And you a liar wonder why you wanna die so young
You and I look just alike
And I'm afraid that this one right here
Might be last time that I write a song
Lot of niggas wanna go out with a bang
But I ain't tryna go out at all
So I ain’t tryna go out at all
Got a lot of ideas still to throw out the door
Last Chance joint gotta be a dance joint
From an introspective drugged out standpoint
Throw bands joint, wanna hold hands joint
Old school for my own old man joint

[Chorus]
Still a chain-smoking, name dropping
Good looking, muh' fucking, motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken, Frank Ocean listening, stain hitting
Satin woodgrain gripping, paint dripping, motha, shut your mouth

[Bridge]
This part right here, right now, right here, this part my shit
I play this so loud in the car, I forget to park my whip
I lean back, then spark my shit, I turn up, I talk my shit
Hope you love all of my shit, I hope you love all of my shit (IGH)

[Verse 2]
Why toss my filter when she saving my life?
The same shit that kills us, always feels so right
That's why I pray to the dealer, God know who he be
Truth be told he juiced me, introduced me to the lucy leaf
Oh oh oh, I seen the light, I lost my lighter
Bic flick, kick the habit and the bucket, fuck your supplier
Lies, Levis on fire, flyer on the wall I'm brighter
In the darkness of the night, in the sky I get higher, higher

[Chorus]
Still a chain-smoking, name dropping
Good looking, muh' fucking, motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken, Frank Ocean listening, stain hitting
Satin woodgrain gripping, paint dripping, motha, shut your mouth

[Bridge]
This part right here, right now, right here, this part my shit
I play this so loud in the car, I forget to park my whip
I lean back, then spark my shit, I turn up, I talk my shit
Hope you love all of my shit, I hope you love all of my shit (IGH)

[Chorus]
Still a chain-smoking, name dropping
Good looking, muh' fucking, motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken, Frank Ocean listening, stain hitting
Satin woodgrain gripping, paint dripping, motha, shut your mouth[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
We just been smoking a bowl
We just been smoking
We just been smoking a bowl
We just been smoking a bowl
We just been
We just been smoking a bowl
We just been smoking a bowl
We just been smoking a, we just
What the fuck is going on?
When did we buy a bowl?

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
We just been smoking a bowl
We don't got no time to roll
I'm always out on the road
She don't got time for a whole
Little bit of time that we have
We used to purchase a half
It don't be no time to smoke
I'm always throwing on clothes
She always throwing a fit
We don't got no time for no sex
I just put milk in the bowl
She don't be cooking at all
She just put weed in the bowl
She don't have time for herself
She putting points on the board, yes
You know she carry her own
You know she carry a child
She wake up at crack of dawn
She don't be cracking a smile
So when she packing the bowl
I grab her, I tell her

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
Let me crack this blunt
Slow it down for a second
Break it down, ooh
She said, "let me lick this blunt"
Slow it down for a second
Break it down, ooh
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, a smoke break
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, a smoke break

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Truth being told, we used to movies and bowl
We used to Netflix and roll
I used to pass her the smoke
She used to laugh at my jokes
You pat my back when I choke
Wish we were stuck in our ways
We way too young to get old
We stuck together like oowops
We smoke to Fetty, sing ZooWap
Traphouse 3, Guwop
I shoulda knew when I grew up
It would be no time at all
We went from White Owls to Raws
We went from joints to a bowl
She need a second to breathe
We need an actual smoke sesh

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
Let me crack your back
Slow it down for a second
Take it down, ooh
Let me run this back
Slow it down for a minute
You deserve, you deserve
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, a smoke break
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, a smoke break

[Verse 3: Future]
I don't have time to finesse
I put some ice on your neck
But I ain't holding you back
I spend my time on the road
Super ain't saving no hoes
I don't have time to patrol
Let me break these bales right down for a second
When it touch down, ooh
I got to lay back the roof
I got her breakin' the new rules
She can't be taking no calls
When she involved with a boss
Please don't get lost in the sauce
Please don't get lost in the sauce
She been like this from the door
Told me her mom was a whore
I gave her percs for myself
I give her a perc for esteem
I'm tryna crown me a queen
You hear the chains when they cling
I take the molly its clean
I push the whip with the wings
I gotta be overseas
I gotta be on the pedal
I push it down to the floor
I got designer galore
I keep some Goyard and gars
I smoke out all of my cars
You smell the weed in the air
You smell the smoke in the seats
You went and had our child
You didn't abandon the D
You got me twisted at least
You can

[Hook: Chance The Rapper & Future]
Let me crack your back
Let me rub you all over
Take it down, ooh
Let me make this blunt
Make you dinner or somethin'
You deserve, you deserve
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, a smoke break
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, a smoke break4 or 5 hours on the road
I was doin' doughs, I was gettin' golds
I was in Africa, I was gettin' gold
I was with Nate, Nate said wait
Put it on a steak, put it on a plate
Call up my homies in another state(Ooh!)
Gettin' hella great
Gettin' hella cheese, put it on a grate
That's shredded cheese
(You too hot. Light fire on these bitches!)
FWOOSH!!![Intro: AZ + (Nas)]
Aiyo, what's up, what's up?
Let's keep it real, son, count this money
You know what I'm sayin'? (Yeah yeah)
Aiyo, put the Grants over there in the safe
You know what I'm sayin'?
‘Cause we spendin' these Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
(I'm sayin' that's what this is all about right
Clothes, bankrolls and hoes)

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
You a bitch
And when I say bitch I don't mean a bitch
But speakin' of bitches I'm with your bitch
And you ain't on shit cause you'se a bitch
You's a bitch
You a bitch
And when I say bitch I don't mean a bitch
But speakin' of bitches I'm with your bitch
And you ain't on shit cause you'se a bitch
You a bitch

[Verse 1: Kami de Chukwu]
Love or her not
As long as she run through your thots
Then she the best that you got
Focused on tying the knot
Or the run down, come up, I keep it on lock
Bitch
Fuckin' deuce, bitch

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Who is you, is you the same?
You'se a lame
I'm you shit you'se a nuisance
Lose your life when I told you that you should hang
You should beg
You should beg with chasers
Stop chasin' Chance
I be takin' chances when I be tryna blaze a dance
Raise a man
Thumbin' through like lasers when I laser beam
You'se a fuckin' loser and you chase it with some (?)
I need me some magic beans and a fuckin' stalker
So I could climb that bitch to the top of mount of lava
And the whole damn parkin' lot
But it be ridin', it be ridin' all my niggas just like Dennis
They be robbin', they be Rodman
I'm comin' through it pimpin'
I be pimpin', I be drippin' when I'm off the fuckin' acid
And that

[Verse 3: Towkio]
Me I'm a pimp
All in your crib
With your bitch
Watchin' Netflix
Bet that I hit
She ask where you at me
I tell her don't trip
I tell her don't trip
Like hope you gettin' a hint
Hope you gettin' a hint
Or feelin' the rain
God damn motherfucker no gin
Let me hit

[Outro]
We're not against rap, we're not against rappers
But we are against those thugs
