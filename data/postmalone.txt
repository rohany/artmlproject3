And if I owe you something, I'ma pay it
If you want to say something, then say it
If you want to try the jewels, make my day

I used to say I was free
Now all these people wanna keep on takin' pieces of me
They take away everything, had everything that I needed
They held me down, let me drown
They spit me out, right through the teeth
I can't pretend, ash in the wind, won't blow again
It was a breeze for you (Breeze for you)
These hurricanes inside of my brain, let it rain, made it look easy Can't look away, you love the pain, you love the pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Watchin' me bleed
You cut me down on my knees
No matter what you believe
I think we both can agree

It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me (Ayy)
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
I couldn't breathe
Almost lost myself, couldn't stop myself, I did it all
You can't blame it on me (Ayy)
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault

[Verse 2]
Every day's the same, yeah, I just watch 'em go
As I scrape away through the impossible
Yeah, I played the game but it was all for show
Tryna find my way, I nearly lost it though
Now I see dead people, most have no faith
Where did the time go? A watch with no face
They hit the ceilin', but my roof likes space
I took my chances so won't you

[Chorus]
Blame it on me (Ayy)
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me (Ayy)
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
I couldn't breathe
Almost lost myself, couldn't stop myself, I did it all
You can't blame it on me (Ayy)
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault, not my fault

[Bridge]
It's all my fault that I'm addicted to the clothes
It's all my fault, I paid the cost, yeah
It's all my fault that I ain't givin' up my soul
It's all my fault

Never know when someone comes and tries to take my life
I've been sleepin' with the .45 like every night
In the whip I pray to God I don't see flashin' lights
God damn, they right behind me
And I wake up everyday
I wake up every day with this anxiety
And they know where I stay
Got "Malone" on my plates
And they followin' me
Two hundred bands under the floor of the kitchen
A little more up in the walls and the ceilin'
Even family and friends started switchin'
Ever since I got that check, seen 'em itchin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Eyes open, I see you, I'm watchin' you
More people wanna be you, don't trust no one

[Chorus]
Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't get no sleep)

A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

[Verse 2]
Sometimes feel like I got no friends
Can't trust a soul, like I'm Snowden
Right by the bed, keep it loaded
Lord have mercy if they broke in
I don't ever sleep, yeah, I'm wide awake
If you try to pull up to my place
Beam is gonna hit you a mile away
I promise, one of us gonna die today
Helicopters in the sky
No, he can't escape the eyes
Politicians and the lies
Tell me, what's the point in pickin' sides?

[Chorus]
Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't get no sleep)

[Bridge]
(Ayy) Mind is runnin' all day
Cost me more than money and I'm payin' the price, yeah
I ain't goin' nowhere
Killin' myself so I can make me a life, yeah
Minute after minute, never had a limit
Woke up every mornin', knew that I just had to get it
Windows always tinted, you ain't lookin' in it
Either way, I know they'll come for me again

[Chorus]
Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't get no sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peaceLyrics from snippet

You all in my section tryna come to my session
We rollin' up pressure, you know that we flexin'
We bought all the bottles, we came with the models
Girl this a confession, I'm not like your exes
I came up from Texas, and now that we textin'
You can fly in whenever, now you undressin'

And I'm like "Whoa, man, my neck so goddamn cold”

She said, "Can I have some to hold?"
And I can't ever tell you no

I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it’s gonna take (What it's gonna take)
Another foreign or a bigger chain (Bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Bridge]
I promise
I swear to you, I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life (Love of my life)

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

We standin' in the lobby waitin' for the elevator

Let's just go crazy, let's say, "Fuck every'"
Let's make a baby, we gon' need new laundry

[Verse 1]
Ohh, whoa, I'm on the road
Can't wait to come home to you
Ohh, I'm doin' all my shows
Can't wait to come back home to you

[Chorus]
Red wine and white sheets, pour out that Henny

Red wine and white sheets, pour out that Henny
I know that you love me, let's fall like we're lonely

[Verse 2]
I know I lied to you, that only would do you
I told you I'm sorry, you know that was not me
And that [?] was rushin' through my fingertips
I ain't never gonna go back to the man I was then

[Chorus]
Red wine and white sheets, pour out that Henny
I know that you love me, let's fall like we're lonely

Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If'n you don't know by now
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It'll never do somehow
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I’ll be gone
You’re the reason that I’m traveling on
But, don’t think twice, that’s all right

[Verse 2]
Well, it ain't no use in turning off your light, babe
The one that I never knowed
Well, it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I’m on the dark side of the road
Well, I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway
But, don’t think twice, that’s all right

[Verse 3]
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe
Like you've never done before
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe
I can’t hear you anymore
Well, I’m thinking and wondering, walking down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I’m told
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
But, don’t think twice, that’s all right

[Verse 4]
Well, so long, honey babe
Where I’m bound, I cannot tell
Well, goodbye's too good a word, babe
So, I’ll just say fare thee well
Well, I'm not saying that you treated me unkind
You could have done better but, hey, I don’t mind
You just kind of wasted my precious time
But, don’t think twice, that’s all right

[Outro]
But, don't think twice, that's all right
Well, don't think twice, that's all right[Intro]
Good job, First!

Glamorization of this lifestyle will leave you desperate

Look, let me start this off
Rap game got me pissed off, I'm coming to take it, there's no competition
I'm like that little sign that say I to commission
For those who don't listen, I demand detention
My new name should be shitload of issues
When we at the venue, they don't have a shot, they like unloaded pistols
And I'm countin' my money, I'm big in there honey
They call me billi' for short
Baby, my crib like we own a resort
But yo, that ain't important, what is anymore?
I got bars on bars on bars on bars on bars
And a bad bitch at my car
And she smart, and her frame, please don't get me started
Look, she don't wanna do normal shit
Tryna call me 'bout my government
And she only know the mogul for a couple minutes
But we out in public like we a couple wit' it
You ain't squad, then we ain't fuckin' wit' it
Plus, I really skate so there is a difference
If you ask me, they failed the mission
But you can come to the crib, see how we livin'

All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta (-sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi

Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', "Rest in peace to Bon Scott" (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison (-son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', "I'm with the band" (ayy, ayy)
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend (yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Oh shit, hey

Hey, she been givin' me head for twenty minutes, man, this bitch gotta have lockjaw
Ain't no retirin', bitch I'm firin' out the car, let the Glock off
Hey, and it's a job, take the car to the karate shop and chop that bitch like water
Man, my shit been going back-to-back, grrra-ta-ta-ta, just like a choppa
Police pull up behind me, ain't no time to go and hide it, throw the rock far
Valuable, for twenty minutes, oh man, my shit is 'bout as swole as a gold bond
I got plenty more, prolly fifty more, but this is what we did so far-ar-ar

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
This that Amethyst Rockstar-life, might not make it
Drop gems 'til I shine bright, just be patient
Two girls in my hotel bathroom naked
That's the type of thrill that I like, don't waste it
My cup filled with no chaser, I'm wasted
Mixin' weed with the Henny, got me cross-faded
Like, "Sorry, no interviews, y'all caught in the Matrix"
Checkin' for statements, life is what you make it
I'm never on vacation 'cause there's no days off
All the hard work, dedication, know it all pays off
I been gettin' no sleep, I been workin' graveyard shifts
I'm a Braveheart, shit, they call me the Sergeant
The general, my squadron, the Pro Era army
Droppin' bombs, this is just the calm before the storm, see
They can never harm me, my brother catch a homi
T-Pain, Post Malone, Joey Bad, this is godly
Huh, hahaha

Lighting stog after stog, I choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
They help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup
Blunt after blunt
I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck, ha, ha, ha, uh
In the cut and I put that on my momma
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either pussy or the commas

With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Verse 2]
Uh, yeah, push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but she says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sendin' all her friends snaps of my new tracks
'Cause all these hoes know what's about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands I just wanna go

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep pouring
And I ain't seen a light of day since, well, that's not important
It's been long
And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip the Houston
Cars and clothes, thought I was winning, you knew I was losing
You told me to wake up but my clock always stays on snooze
And I'm done

[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowing
Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
And I've been looking for someone that I can buy my drugs from
It seems like every plug ran east to Utah, became Mormons
Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on
Sober, ugh
I had 80 beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do then
I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune
And lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
Drank more

[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowing
Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

Spent so much cash, I lost her
My cup was too toxic

Dropped plenty money on her thighs
There's plenty room in my ride
I've never been like a small fry
She took me in, that's on my life

Yeah, when I walk up in a party, they all act like they know me
Then I spotted lil' mama through the wall of jabronis (Ooh)
Point her out so I can bag her if they just bring her to me (bring her to me)
I ain't even see the face, but she got beautiful boobies (Wow)
And she see those diamonds in my teeth (In my teeth)

Hago lo que quiera, compro lo que quiera, porque soy un rockstar (-tar)
Voy pa'l avión privado en el Ferrari, en el tablero "180" (180)
Voy de camino a Suiza pa' lanzar mi propio Hublot a la venta
Y voy llamando al Russo porque quiero gastarme un millón en prendas

[Verso 1: Nicky Jam]
Una Panamera, un F12 frente a casa
Gucci, Ferragamo, compro todo plaza (ajá)
Rhino pa' los cortas, ratas que te cazan
Miles de hipócritas que vienen y te abrazan (yeh, yeh)
Vivo la vida como un rey (rra)
Kilos de música de Medellín a Monterrey (rey)
Siempre cruzando todos los límites de la ley (ley)
Mi movie siempre está en play (play)
Vivo la vida como un rockstar
Los que tiraron ya no existen, obvio no están
Tengo brujas que con los palos te acuestan
Con peine doble lleno que se manifiestan (woo)
Dicen que el dinero el alma me consume
Yo sigo celebrando en un jet por las nubes
Nadie me las daba cuando abajo solo estuve
Ahora la cuenta nunca declina, siempre sube
Siempre sube, siempre sube, siempre (woo!)

Maybach, G Wagon, la llevo al privado
30 mil de altura, de camino a Colorado
Le regalo un AP en oro rosado

L.A. nights getting too damn high
Codeine in my blood, mud in my Sprite
Nicotine in the bud and the L.A. lights
Fuck all that shit about your human rights
I'ma make it real clear, shit black and white
I don't wanna see your face in my line of sight
Oh boy, try stuntin' on me? It don't happen
Couple Benji's stashed in that mattress
Told her back it up, she ass-backwards
Told her I'ma bring her back to my address
Told her she can have a sip of my Activ'
She gon' smoke on weed and then she gon' ash it
Told her girl, don't be gettin' distracted
Boy I pull up-up with your whore
That voodoo good so I roll it
Thirteen blunts, boy I smoke it
Thirteen life, boy I know it
Throw four in it when I'm feelin' Whitney
All this drinking is killing my kidneys
All this sip I'm sippin' gon' kill me
And motherfuckers walkin' if they ain't ridin' with me
Teeth shine in my mouth
Bad bitches all on my couch
You know it's foreign when I back out
Hit 'em with the woo-wap, she black out
Boy, I done drank so much I passed out
Hoes fall asleep and all they ass out
Boy, I done drank so much I passed out
Woke up in the spot, I'ma cash out

I been waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take
Take me right to you
One hundred bottles of the good shit couldn't even bring you back
What am I to do?
Feel like I'm circlin' a drain, all I see is the remains of an ugly truth (Of an ugly truth)
One hundred models I could follow all the way to hell and back, but they can't replace you (They can't replace you)

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh, ohh

[Verse 1]
I was puttin' on for you like a jersey
What I didn't know then couldn't hurt me
Never thought that you'd go and do me dirty
Left me in the cold, but on the inside I was burnin'
But that's just the way it goes
Wish that I could have control
Everybody dies alone
(And I ain't dead yet)

[Refrain]
Say my prayers, but I lost faith a long time ago (A long time ago)
Dream nightmares
I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope (Guess we're losing hope)
I don't even wonder why you don't answer when I call your name
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?

[Chorus 2]
I'm still waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take
Take me right to you (Take me right to you)
One hundred vials of denial, I know they won't bring you back
What am I to do? (What am I to do?)
You’re my alibi and motive when I'm lyin' to myself, what an ugly truth (What an ugly truth)
We’re no strangers to the flame
We will never be the same if we make it through (And we can make it through)

[Verse 2]
My back is up against the wall
But I used to feel invincible
Yeah, it was us against the world
But somehow, someway, the tables turned
I remember back then
Played my cards right you were my best hand
Still you keep me guessin'
Wonder if I'll ever get the message

[Refrain]
Say my prayers, but I lost faith a long time ago (A long time ago)
Dream nightmares
I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope (Guess we're losing hope)
I don't even wonder why you don't answer when I call your name
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?

Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?[Snippet]

Let me tell you a little story
Hey girl, love me

[Verse 1: Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
In the middle of a cold dark night
I heard a sound and I thought to myself, "What was that?"
I got up and checked
It was you walking out my door
You said you loved me just moments before
Why'd you lie?
What the heck?

[Chorus: Post Malone as Leon DeChino & Jason Stokes as Jazzy Eff]
Our love was as hot as a torch
But you couldn't take it anymore
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
My heart was beating like a very fast drum
You looked at me and said I'm not number one
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?

[Interlude: Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
Let me introduce you to my friend, Jazzy Eff

[Verse 2: Jason Stokes as Jazzy Eff &  Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
Don't you know my friend would do anything?
He would sing to you from winter to spring
You betrayed him
You should go away
He really, really, really misses you bad (Yes he does)
He remembers all the times that y'all had
He's crying (I'm crying)
That's not okay

[Chorus: Post Malone as Leon DeChino & Jason Stokes as Jazzy Eff]
Our love was as hot as a torch
But you couldn't take it anymore
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
My heart was beating like a very fast drum
You looked at me and said I'm not number one
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?

[Bridge: Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
Stop, girl, what have you done?
You used to be sweet just like bubblegum
Now you are no fun
You suck, you broke my heart
Stop, girl, what have you done?
You used to be sweet just like bubblegum
Now you are no fun
You suck, you broke my heart

Our love was as hot as a torch
But you couldn't take it anymore
Why don't you love me?

You looked at me and said I'm not number one
Why don't you love me?

Yeah, stuntin', it's satisfyin' but it don't bring you closure
Diamonds my state of mind, I'm drownin' in the ocean
Just stay right where you are and don't come any closer
I'm just gon' handle mine and just maintain composure
People, they say learn from mistakes, yeah
You keep your space, yeah, but all this pain, yeah
You say you go away, yeah, stay in my lane though
You hurt so bad when you went away, yeah
I needed you, needed you
So what the fuck do I do?
I needed you, needed you
So what the fuck do I do? Yeah

Oh my God, oh my God

Remember when I fell in love?

Thrown the check like a Nike, I just do it

[Bridge]
Oh my God, oh my God
A lot of bullshit on my mind
Oh my God, oh my God
I think about you all the time
Oh my God, oh my God

She said, "Love me" so I love her
She said, "Leave me" so I left
Then I went to California
And I ain't never comin' back

And I ain't sayin' that I love her
But this bitch is gonna drive me mad

[Verse 1]
When you leave me, make me jump up off my roof
Didn't faze you, would've given you the moon
Even after everything that we've been through
I ain't never met nobody like you
Why you always tryna tell me that it's cool?
Need to quiet 'cause you never tell the truth
Felt like ballin' was the only thing to do
Trade my woman for some diamonds and a coupe

[Pre-Chorus]
When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended
No discussion, yeah we gotta go our separate ways
Won't take me down in flames
I don't even wanna know your name
Watch how everything is gonna change, yeah, ayy

[Chorus]
I'ma pull up in a Bentley
With a fuckin' hunnid thousand in my pocket, yeah, yeah

And I don't give a fuck if you don't like it, yeah, yeah
Just to show you that it's over
It don't matter what you gotta say about it, yeah
I'ma put that bitch pussy in a motherfuckin' bodybag
So you know that I'm never ever coming back
You kept your heart on the counter in a Prada bag
I used to never ever want to see the light of day, yeah
I was an idiot
Beggin' on my knees onto the floor
Now, I don't even want you anymore, anymore
It's over now
It's over now, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy

[Verse 2]
Feels like a knife in my throat, you treat this like it's a joke
I bet you've done this before, I ain't surprised, yeah
I wasn't tryna let go, but you'll know why when I'm ghost
I hope you wind up alone, dead in my eyes, yeah
Ain't religious, only Christian when it's Dior
Only prayin' for the Amex and the gold
You ain't stop me, no, you only was a detour
Tried to drive me crazy, you ran out of road

[Pre-Chorus]
When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended
No discussion, yeah we gotta go our separate ways
Won't take me down in flames
I don't even wanna know your name
Watch how everything is gonna change (is gonna change), yeah, ayy

And the money, but let's skip the obvious shit
Ain't living too long if I'm living like this
Early morning waking up with the sweats
Going through shit I ain't never forget
But nothing I do, will I ever regret
I need me that cheque, I need me that chronic
I don't remember, tell me what's my name?
Drinking, swerving in the other lane
Fucking zooted drinking acid rains
Spill it on Supreme

Slaved for the man and I broke my fuckin' back
So you can take your nine-to-five and shove it up your ass
And that 101 like the highway in hell
Going too damn fast, I spilled drink on my Chanel
And I woke up and my room's fuckin' trashed like a damn hotel
And where I'm goin' next, now, only time will tell

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh

No, it ain't that difficult for me to forget that you ever exist
Bet you remember my name when I pull up in that whip that doesn't exist (Skrrt)

Pass me them drugs, motherfucker let me try 'em
At the White House, call my homie Joe Biden, he flyin' out weed
Smokin' my dope, Bathing Ape, that be the clothe
Man, don't be silly, that shit you rockin' is old

Feel like Meek Milly but I ain't from Philly
I'm poppin' a wheelie, I show off my grillie
I do this for real-y and for my fam-ily
Same shit every night, man, it's all so famil'-y

It's true that all that you know is all that you are
You said that it's all that you want and more
Fuck off and pour another drink
And tell me what you think
You know that I'm too drunk to talk right now
You put your cigarette out on my face
So beautiful, please, woman

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery

[Chorus]
Tell me that it's all okay (Tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (Waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to—

[Verse 2]
Stay a little longer if you convince me
And tell me all the things that you have against me
Every time we make up, the truth is fadin'
Everybody's blind when the view's amazin'
Damn, who are we right now?
Can we have a little conversation?
Figure it out with no intoxication
We carry on, what is our motivation?
We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it?
Maybe we're used to this
Tell me, what are we to do?
It's like we only play to lose
Chasin' pain with an excuse
I love that shit and so do you

[Pre-Chorus]
But don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery

[Chorus]
Tell me that it's all okay (Tell me that it's all okay)

I'm tryna call your number (brrrr)
You've been playin' way too long (playin' way too long)
I've been smokin' on that strong
In the studio too long
Blowin' on that horn
I'm just tryna get that on, woah
And I ain't tryna stunt man, I'm tryna be honest
And the style, that's swag, bitch, you know I be on it (ooh, ooh)
I get you what you want, I get you what you want (you know that I will)
With that Christian Louboutin, I get you that shoe on (you know that I will)
You a shoo-in for first place (ayy)
But I'm feelin' so blue, ayy
And I'm sippin' a forty (oh)
She keep playin' like Blu-Ray (oh)
Drop the top on that toupee (skrrt)
And I might cop that today (skrrt)
But I need me a you-day (oaky)
And I'm just tryna hit it (woah), we could go up on a Tuesday (like Makonnen, like Makonnen)
And I'm tryna fuck, why you playin' with me? (Why, why, why, why, why)
Why you playin' with me? (Why, why, why, why, why)
Girl, I'm tryna call your number, tryna call your number

[Verse 2: 1st]
What's up with the what's up?
Line goin' crazy
I got two phones, one an I, one a flip
That's the one all the flips hit (haha, hello?)
She call me when she wanna do the gymnast shit
I got her doin' somersaults, Gabby Douglas backflips
So when's the last time you seen a big dick?
She said she like to kiss 'cause I got big lips
And we got all that chemistry
She show me images
Pop a bean, now we limitless
You ain't gotta be real, baby, we could just pretend, aw
I got her coughin' and wheezin' every time I pass her the indo
Aw, goddamn, bruh, all this sauce
Keypad, unlock, then she pop her top (brrp)
Girl, pick up the phone when I call you

[Chorus: Post Malone]

The reason why I tell you what's up
Baby, don't you know that's what's up?[Intro - Sample]

[Verse 1]
Woke up in a hot tub, spillin' Moet, in the water
Then I light my marijuana, take a shot up out the choppa
J's jumpin' out the locker, spend a little guapa
She want candy, Aaron Carter
I called her Candy when I saw her, pull up with my brothers
Candy-painted flyin' saucer, test me, you'll get flyin' colors

[Pre-Chorus]
Hunnid bitches comin' up the steps
Turn the front lights on, when I know they on they way
She said she don't wanna do too much drugs
Believe me, baby, I do this shit like every day, like every day

[Chorus]
She don't want a thing, I don't want a thing
She come over, pop a couple beans
And that's it, and that's it, ayy
She don't want a thing, I don't want a thing
She come over, pop a couple beans
And that's it, and that's it
(Stoney, Stoney, uh, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Wanna talk about them Martins?
Do you wanna talk about them Jordans?
Enjoy a 40 every mornin', Everclear and some recordin'
101, on the 101 like Jeff Gordon
I just popped a pill, she just popped a pill
And we might just pop some more, I ain't stoppin' 'til like 20
Up until like 4, SmartWater like some dummies
Takin' shots up out the semi, that shit kill me like I'm Kenny

[Pre-Chorus]
Uh, bitches walkin' down the steps
Turn the front lights off, got a blunt all to myself
No, I don't want all this shit to get too deep
But listen, baby, there ain't no shit with you and me
No "you and me," no

[Chorus]
She don't want a thing, I don't want a thing
She come over, pop a couple beans
And that's it, and that's it, ayy
She don't want a thing, I don't want a thing
She come over, pop a couple beans
And that's it, and that's it
And that's it

[Outro - Sample][Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Mmm, ayy

Diamonds going crazy like they on the dance floor
Got a lot of ass, nothin' I can't handle

Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ayy
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy
I made my first million, I'm like, "Shit, this is it," ayy
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like "Whoa, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, "Can I have some to hold?"
And I can't ever tell you no

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
The AP goin' psycho, my Rollie goin' brazy
I'm hittin' lil' mama, she wanna have my babies
It's fifty on the pinky, chain so stanky
You should see the whip, promise I can take yo' bitch
Dolla ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top
Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop (Hey)
Ayy, take you to the smoke shop
We gon' get high, ayy, we gon' hit Rodeo
Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums
This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright
Saint Laurent jeans, still in my Vans though
All VVS', put you in a necklace
Girl, you look beautiful tonight
Stars on the roof, they matching with the jewelry

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload

(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)

I never thought that it would hit this hard
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)
I never thought that it would hit this hard

[Verse 1]
Don't do that, I tell you so
Don't overdose, like no, no, no
Oh my God, what have you become?
The traces of you, no, I can't see them
What have you become? What have you turned to?
What have you taken? Like someone hurt you
You drink that mixture, that shit gon' hit you
No, I can't fix you, no, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Oooh, yeah

I feel a change in the air tonight
I saw myself in a different light

I never thought that it would hit this hard
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)
I never thought that it would hit this hard

[Chorus]
I just keep running and running and running around
I never thought that it would hit this hard
The feeling is different instead when you wake on the ground
I never thought that it would hit this hard
I don't know who I was in and I don't know anymore
I never thought that it would hit this hard
In the city, we sinning, we don’t ever want to come down
I never thought that it would hit this hard

[Verse 2]
Me and J take over and we way up
Now high above the city of angels
Smoke a boge in the sky, pass the fuego
I already dropped something in the Faygo
Only came to the club 'cause they paid us
Take this shit and lemme see what you made of
No sleep, little mama, we gon' stay up
Vampires on a night in Las Vegas

[Pre-Chorus]
Oooh, yeah
I ran through, yeah
I feel a change in the air tonight
I saw myself in a different light
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)

(Ooh, yeah, yeah)
I never thought that it would hit this hard

I just keep running and running and running around
I never thought that it would hit this hard
The feeling is different instead when you wake on the ground
I never thought that it would hit this hard
I don't know who I was in and I don't know anymore
I never thought that it would hit this hard
In the city, we sinning, we don’t ever want to come down
I never thought that it would hit this hard
I just keep running and running and running around
I never thought that it would hit this hard
The feeling is different instead when you wake on the ground
I never thought that it would hit this hard
I don't know who I was in and I don't know anymore
I never thought that it would hit this hard
In the city, we sinning, we don’t ever want to come down
I never thought that it would hit this hard
